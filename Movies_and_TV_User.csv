0,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"really happy they got evangelised .. spoiler alert==happy ending liked that..since started bit worrisome... but yeah great stories these missionary movies, really short only half hour but still great"
1,A2VHSG6TZHU1OB,"Having lived in West New Guinea (Papua) during the time period covered in this video, it is realistic, accurate, and conveys well the entrance of light and truth into a culture that was for centuries dead to and alienated from God."
2,A23EJWOW1TLENE,Excellent look into contextualizing the Gospel and God's sovereignty over cultural barriers. The book and movie are both captivating. I would definitely recommend to both Christians and non-believers.
3,A1KM9FNEJ8Q171,"More than anything, I've been challenged to find ways to share Christ is a culturally relevant way to those around me.  Peace child is a cherished ""how to"" for me to do that."
4,A38LY2SSHVHRYB,"This is a great movie for a missionary going into a foreign country, especially one that is not used to foreign presence. But, it was a little on the short side."
5,AHTYUW2H1276L,This movie was in ENGLISH....it was a great summary of the book and the experience of the Richardsons while in New Guinea.
6,A3M3HCZLXW0YLF,"This is a fascinating true story, well acted by many of the actual characters.  Watch this and see just one of countless examples of how faithfully God works out ways for all of mankind to find Him, in every culture."
7,A1OMHX76O2NC6V,This DVD appears to be in German. It is not in english. I do not speak German.  This needs to be corrected. I want my $1.99 back.
8,A3OBOZ41IK6O1M,This movie is not in English although the title of the movie is as is the book. There is no forewarning anywhere that the movie is not in English. Sounds like it might be Russian?
9,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,"So sorry I didn't purchase this years ago when it first came out!!  This is very good and entertaining!  We absolutely loved it and anticipate seeing it repeatedly.  We actually wore out the cassette years back, so we also purchased this same product on cd.  Best purchase we made out of all!  Would purchase on dvd if we could find one."
10,A1XIXLXK9B4DAJ,"Product received quickly from seller. Product was in great condition as stated. People who enjoy southern gospel music will be thrilled with this offering by the various Cathedral performers, with the exception of Payne and Younce, down through the years. Also quite happy with service. Would use seller again."
11,AFTUJYISOFHY6,Believe me when I tell you that you will receive a blessing watching this video of the Cathedral Quartet.  They bring back most of the singers that were ever in their group and it is a really great VHS.
12,AEIAQFCWNRUSE,This video arrived in perfect shape to the far away country of New Zealand It is a really blessing to see all the different members of the quartet over the years. Great singing! Pastor Greg
13,A16WO8T4YXGVWP,"The Reunion of the Cathedral Quartet in 1995 was an effort to salute the men who had contributed to this great Southern Gospel quartet.  The driving force behind the quartet was Glen Payne and George Younce, who remained with the group through several personnel changes.  This video is full of moments of laughter and sentiment, and the music is outstanding."

15,AIPN1XFK37ZWI,This is truly a moving video to watch if you like great southern gospel quartets. It has some of the greatest singers that have made up the greatest gospel quartet of all time and even the ones that have not been  with the Cathedrals for 30 years still sound fantastic. It is a blessing to  watch.
16,A7H20K09VIXXT,"It is an excellent experience to watch this DVD after all these years of being an X fan.  It was also very cool to watch this right after a repeated viewing of the DVD X--The Unheard Music (1985).  X still has every ounce of energy and connection it had back then. The only reason I gave it four stars is that John Doe's Bass is overshadowed in the mix.  But having said that, it is a DVD I will treasure for years to come."
17,A2LGI22B6XRZVA,"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come."
18,A2A4GWAEM3VOW0,"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!"
19,A226BMXAQAJVOQ,"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????"
20,AIL0Y2OUE1680,"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living."
21,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait."
22,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers."
23,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good."
24,AE377LB31FT8E,"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real."
25,A13H2MDQBI60SE,"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!"
26,A37J1JXBFXI0YM,"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good."
27,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!"
28,ACZSAM5ZA37SP,I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.
29,A3G77LSZPLZ74U,"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!"
30,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Another hilarious classic by/with the inimitable Mel Brooks! This one's as funny as ""Young Frankenstein,"" and it's fun to watch again and again. The cast is top notch with Leslie Neilson, Harvey Corman, Brooks himself and the actor who plays Renfield -- all great and a chuckle a minute. Even the special effects are good.

I highly recommend this for anyone with a campy sense of humor."
31,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"i think she tried to convert him and forgot if she won him over you will have to see it to find out, i think was good one to my memory"
32,ACZSAM5ZA37SP,I've seen this movie a few times and always enjoyed it because it's the same time frame for me in high school. I thought the HD quality was very good and the sound was better than the standard 5.1. I definitely recommend it and I am sure I will watch this movie over for many years!
33,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"good film with lots of nice music, one of better versions of christmas carol music wise."
34,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"This film is complete junk.  I should know better, because hollywood (it gets a small ""h"" because that is all they deserve) always does this to us.  There was only one possible option with a modern version of Apes, and that was to make an exact version of Pierre Boulle's (sp?) brilliant novel, and I mean exact.  The original Apes film is a masterpiece, and with the obscene amount of money they had for the budget, they could have hit a home run with the film version of the book, but instead, dreck.  Cheers."
35,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,kind of weird one though..? not as classic or normal/sane  or inspiring as others i have seen.. . . ..
36,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Just picked this up, I usually catch this every several years on TV, but finally had to buy it.  On a side note, this shows why blu-ray is having a hard time catching on.  I just got a 65 inch tv, and even this, sub-par quality picture ""regular"" DVD is totally passable (especially for the $6.99 I paid for it!).  Anyways, my personal connection to this goes back to 1978 when my family took a vacation to San Fran and we toured Alcatraz.  They were refurbishing sections of the prison for the upcoming film starring Clint Eastwood.  Even though I was a lad, I was already a huge fan of Clint!  When the film came out, we went and saw it in the theater, I was fascinated.  Final note, look up this subject on the net, there was just a posting about a manuscript that came from Seattle and the owner gave it to the authorities to look into.  This story says that the three men did make it, and then were murdered for money and buried off I-90 somewhere in Washington.  Maybe? who knows?  Also, the Mythbusters episode dealing with this was good as well.  A good story, but remember, Crime dosen't pay!  cheers."
37,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"This is most definitely NOT lesbian cinema. Rather it is a touching love story between two people; one of whom happens to be a lesbian and the other (Hemmingway), who is bi. The writing, casting and direction of this movie are top-notch. The only negative is that it is rather anti-climactic due to the ridiculous boycott of the 1980 Olympics by the US government."
38,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I don't know why I do this, just because I'm a Zepplein freak I guess.  I just can't let another ""Zeppelin weren't very good this night"" comment slide.  People who write that just don't know what they are talking about, period.  Yes, we thankfully have the new DVD, and the West Was Won CD, but to say that they couldn't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE.  To be fair, YES, there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that, and there is the ""fantasy"" footage that may or may not bug you.  BUT, there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory!  The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC, Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere, who knows where!  Anyway you cut it, the band is in AMAZING form, pure and simple, and if you are unable to be moved by this performance, that is ok I guess, but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other ""brilliant"" ""artists"" of the like."
39,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I saw this when I was a kid and never forgot it. It really leaves an impression on the viewer due to the excellent acting, story, and cinematography. This is a classic that younger people should see as they will enjoy it. It's unlike anything that came after. The child star, Patti McCormack is unforgettable in the role she and several other members of the cast perfected on the stage before making the movie.

It's haunting and great! The interviews and commentary bonus features were a very pleasant surprise I enjoyed a lot.

If this film is ever remade, I can assure you the new version will not approach the greatness of the original."
40,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"As many others here have said, this is a very funny movie, especially if you ""get"" all the gay references to vintage films and music popular with gay men. I am a big fan of the English low- budget ""Carry On"" series of films, when I showed this film to a friend the other day, I spotted a couple things I hadn't noted when watching this film previously. The guy who wears chaps at the bath house is Peter Butterworth, who was in many of the ""Carry On"" films. And I swear, lest my eyes deceive me, there's a 5 second or less glimpse of Kenneth Williams as the innocent bystander Kay Ballard bungles into upon entering the bath house. Could be he had a larger role at one point and it was edited out for unknown reason.

When I show this film to people now, they often only recognize Jerry Stiller as Ben's father or from his role in ""Seinfield"". He and his recently-deceased (early June 2015) wife (Ben's mother) were Stiller and Mera (not sure of the latter's spelling), a great comedy duo on film and TV for many years. I recall Kaye Ballard from the old ""Sid Caesar"" pioneer TV show! So there's some[one} old, some[one] new (Treat Williams, a treat in a towel with a ridiculously high voice), some[one] borrowed (the ""Carry On"" folk), and some[one] blue (most of the lead cast members, particularly Stiller) here. Not to mention this film kick-started not only Treat Williams' career but Rita Moreno's (""Googie Gomez"") career as well. She's difficult to understand with her over-done accent, but her lines are hilarious."
41,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"it seemed like there was nothing spiritual in it, so much time was on other stuff they had like 20 seconds mention of the jesus part only?! I gave it away too frustrating waiting for good inspiring christian part ..not a good for Sabbath film haha, more like if have insomnia and want to be bored regular type film..those one star regular kind though"
42,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Sorry guys (the three other reviews) you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm assuming that you three are the types who LOVED the new planet of the apes compared to Heston's real Planet of the Apes right?  Beneath is a damn good film, period.  I suppose you could give it 4.5 stars because it isn't as good as Part I, but COME ON! Beneath is a good film!!  If you like Planet of the Apes, I can not see how you won't enjoy this, the end is almost as good as the original one!  OK, enough.  If you like Apes, watch this, if not, skip it."
43,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Hello, first of all, if you are one of those people who feel that 2001 was pure genius, and you feel that ANYTHING else would be pure crap--you know who you are, then don't waste your time on this.  HOWEVER, if you really loved 2001, and really cared about David Bowman, the Discovery, and HAL, and wanted to see what happened next, this is for you.  When the book came out I was CAPTIVATED, pure and simple.  Of course, since there is no USSR now, the tension is lost to those too young to remember, but watching this again last night really brought back those times to me.  The Chinese parts from Europa that were left out were greatly missed by me.  But, this story/movie is very very good.  The technology and sets are incredible, the acting is very good, and seeing David Bowman again was CHILLING.  After the film was over, I immediately got out my 2063 book to read what happened right this mission, and while I don't remember loving that book, it was very interesting to read the first 50 pages or so again after so many years.  OK, enough rambling, enjoy this, OR, stay up on your pedastal and continue to look down on the rest of us who can watch and enjoy something that isn't 10 out of 10 stars PURE GENIUS!!  Cheers, Jaderain"
44,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Wow, what a film.  Incredible, fantastic.  Really a superior effort.  Any fan of film should watch this.  I guess ""popcorn"" movies have their place, but man, this is where it is at.  Superbly written, acted, filmed.  check it out man!!  cheers."
45,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I thought was Christian film and so wasn't and wasn't even good regular film so dumb haha for real
46,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,pretty cute love story happy but sad ending but that's life..nice perseverance although sometimes made me think if she listened to others counsel maybe would have never happened but then missing out on living your dreams is saddest irony as well so who knows sometimes
47,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I loved this movie when it came out and have loved it ever since. Ever notice there are two cyclops, one with a single horn while the other has two horns? Harryhausen was the best stop-motion artist! How he stayed sane doing so many tedious stop-motion characters, I'll never know.

In the '70s, Kerwin Mattews moved to San Francisco where he opened an antique shop with his long-time lover. He still looked darn good. I'd had a crush on him since I first saw this film, so you can imagine my surprise when Sinbad himself walked into the ice cream store where I was working. It was the first such store to sell vanilla ice cream containing real vanilla beans, and Kerwin (he said it made him feel old when I called him ""Mr. Mathews"") wanted to check it out. We were alone in the shop as he looked around then finally said, ""You're staring, you know. ""Feeling somewhat foolish, I quoted the lines from this movie used to call the genie: ""From the land beyond beyond, from the place past hopes and fear, I bid you [Kerwin Mattews] now appear!"" He smiled as I added that I couldn't help but stare at a great movie star I'd seen in several movies and had always had a big crush on. He laughed, saying he didn't know about the handsome or big star part of what I'd said, but he enjoyed being recognized. We chatted for about 10 minutes, and I was so excited that I forgot to ask for an autograph. He was such a gentleman! He bought about $6 worth of ice cream and tipped me a $20 bill. And yes, at my request, he gave me little kiss on the cheek before he left. He passed away just a very few years later, I'm sorry to say, but I'll never forget him. And I'm so disappointed that  so few people under the age of 40 even remember this great film or any of the others Kerwin did. Well, I miss him! He was a good actor too!"
48,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"This is a very entertaining film!  It is one that I have watched many times over the years.  I actually saw this in the theater, because I was and am such a fan of Chevy Chase.  However, this came out after his heyday, and it was di rigeur (sp?) by that time to bash anything that Chevy did.  I even liked some of his talk show stuff, but that is another matter isn't it!  Say what you want about Chase, he had a fantastic run didn't he?  If you are a fan of comedy, then you must admit that he left his mark.  I can't imagine that anyone watching this couldn't get some entertainment out of it.  If you know it is about an invisible man, then I think you know somewhat what you are getting into, if you don't care about that stuff, then obviously stick to what you like, but this was a good one, and if I were Chevy I'd be very proud to have this in my porfolio of films, cheers."
49,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The only thing really fun or enjoyable about this Western is Lenord Nimoy's role in it. He looks great and wrestles (nude) with Brenner when Leonard's hotel bathtub breaks. Nimoy really had a handsome face and great body, looking especially good with a short beard."
50,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"The guy who wrote the ""official"" Amazon review once again proves that the ""critics"" don't know anything.  What does he think he was trying to prove?  That he can make a name for himself by bashing the top-notch actors and screenplay?  Come on!  We all know that the book is better 99% of the time!!  That being said, this movie is a CLASSIC, pure and simple.  The setting on the beautiful island of Majorica, Spain, is incredible!  The villa/resort where the story takes place is magnificent, and the interplay of the actors is just great.  Ustinov rules in his portrayal of the famed detective.  I have watched and will watch this movie until I die, how do we delete the official bash, uh, I mean review of this film??"
51,A3G77LSZPLZ74U,"Here I am again at the keyboard contemplating why I am so up on ""Demolition Man"". Could it be the science fiction? The action scenes by both Mr. Sylvestor Stallone and Mr. Wesley Snipes (pre-BLADE)? The comedy sparsely yet satisfyingly set in the story? The romantic interest portrayed by a young Sandra Bullock (Sandra you look MARVELOUS!)? I guess it has to be all the above! Oh and the plot line has a nice twisty curvy touch to it! One last note who couldn't fall for a thawed action hero who can knit!"
52,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"yeah I collect these for Sabbath viewing and are usually all very good with good Christian points in them, thanks."
53,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I have puchased many of the Keaton Ultimate Edition blu-rays. The films are great, but the scores by Kino are usually dreadful and detract greatly from the experience of watching these great masterpieces. Please, Kino, do the right thing and provide some alternate scores which will add to the experience rather than detracting from it."
54,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I think every child should see this wonderful piece. I'm not an opera fan by any means, but this production is so delightfully funny, and engagingly done that it makes even the music irresistible. Anna Russell as the witch is great, with her cackling and laughing until she snorts!

I must agree with several other reviewers that the quality of this particular company's dvd is not the best, but it appears to be the only version available. It isn't terrible, as some reviewers claim, however. Unfortunately, it appears to come down to a miss it or accept it situation. I had a VHS copy for years, so I went to Netflix and ordered a copy of this dvd just to see how bad the quality was before buying it. It's a bit fuzzy here and there, and it certainly would be wonderful if someone remastered it from the original, but saying it is unwatchable is going too far. I'd rather have this version than none by far!"
55,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"A lot of sound and fury... signifying NOTHING. The first clue that Lucas didn't have a compelling idea for this film was the mind-numbing ""crawl"" at the beginning of the film. The Pod Race: nothing more than a vapid video game on the big screen. J.J. Binks? More annoying than the Ewoks. Let's get back to the great storytelling and human dimension of the first two films!"
56,A16WO8T4YXGVWP,"If you watch only one version of A Christmas Carol, this should be it.  The fact that it was shot entirely on location in England gives a great sense of realism.  Also, the characters are superbly cast.  George C. Scott will remain, at least for me, the actor I think of when I think of Ebeneezer Scrooge.

The faithfulness to the text is also evident.  Scrooge becomes less a man to be feared than one to be pitied.  It isn't that he is angry with the world as in other versions, is is more that he is missing so much.  When he puts his arms around his nephew and his wife and says, ""God forgive me for the time I've wasted,"" tears come to my eyes, even after 22 seasons of watching.

The interplay between Scrooge and Belle are interesting.  You get the impression that they should have been married and would have been very happy except that Scrooge was in love with money and not her.  When she walks away, I want to scream at him.

You can watch other movies at Christmas, but if you want to be moved, watch this version of A Christmas Carol."
57,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"A friend dragged me to this movie many years ago, and I was blown away. When I watched it again recently, I realized I'd forgotten how truly horrifying this film is; it fits the political and social events of our time particularly well!

It begins as a delightful story of a madman, but greedy, upper-class individuals get the upper hand, turning the story darker and darker. They have to take a wonderful ""madman"" who thinks he is God/Jesus and brainwash him into thinking he is simply Jack, who is headed for Parliamentary leadership in the UK. What they unleash is terrifying and far too real in society today. I'm a published author of horror fiction (2 collections & contributor to many anthologies), and I guarantee the final scene in this film will scare the hell out of any intelligent viewer. Horripilations all over!

The acting is fantastic, particularly O'Toole's and Coral Browne's (late wife of the late Vincent Price) acting are outstanding! Criterion has done the world a great favor in putting this film in such a fine package.

It is a long film (154 min.), but it is definitely worth seeing and owning!"
58,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,well it was quite a likeable film really..pretty g-rated except for the insane wife.. the love story is very very lovely..
59,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"What a fantastic story!  Really unbelievable, but it is true!  Yes, the movie brings hollywood into the story (I always have to spell hollywood with a small ""h"" to show my respect) so, the movie is more thriller than classic, however, it still is good, and I totally disagree that you only need to watch this once.  What is amazing is that we still don't have a conclusive explanation for what happened 100 years ago.  I've read articles about how the lions were simply feasting on what food was available to them--humans.  However, it dosen't really explain why they killed so often.  I've also read the ""rotten teeth"" theory, about how the lions were being driven crazy with pain over decaying teeth, but to the best of my knowledge, none of these have been overwhelmingly accepted.  SO, what is the explanation??"
60,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a great film, but all of the versions that have been released on tape and DVD are the same; they are old, choppy copies with sound and picture glitches through out. I have not downloaded this movie, but it is put out by the same company as the lousy copy marked as being released in 2010 on the Amazon listings. There are no chapter breaks and no subtitles or special features. It's just as cheap as they could make it. The 2011 version is described the same as the 2010 and 2005 versions, and it is put out by a division of the same company. Don't buy this movie in any form until they clean it up and put out the ""smooth"" version we deserve, not another lousy transfer from ""Smooth Video"" or ""1-2-3 Go"", etc."
61,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This great movie is based on the incredibly successful stage play. The movie was not a big hit for some reason, despite incredible performances by Christopher Plummer as (believe it or not) the ""brownie"" Inca King Atahuallpa and Robert Shaw as Pizzaro. The script is a blatant condemnation of mass murder and slavery as condoned by the church. It also touches on the social issue of whether life in the world of the Inca -- where each person's life was planned from birth and no one wanted for food or shelter -- is better or worse than life under a monarch or even in a democracy. The Incas traded individuality and freedom of choice for programmed lives; the film lets the viewer make up his or her own mind on this.  A third, more subtle theme is the intensity of the bond Pizzaro forms with the captive Inca king. It verges on the homoerotic, which is an interesting take, particularly considering the historical facts. When Pizzaro refuses to execute Atahuallpa, De Soto asks (sarcastically) if he loves the Inca king.  Pizzaro responds by admitting that if he does not love Atahuallpa, there's no chance he'll learn of it anywhere else.

Thus we have a beautifully filmed movie with a great screenplay, great music/singing, and acting.  The only thing missing is a good, clean copy of the film!!!!! I've seen video copies and this dvd copy, and all of them have skips, a few scratches, occasional color distortion, and too-quick cuts in them.  Hopefully someone will give this excellent film the remastering it truly deserves, until then, this is the best available video version. It will irk you a few times when a word is lost or the film jumps too quickly from one scene to another, but if you are willing to tolerate these minor irritants, you'll love the film itself."
62,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I have recently been looking at more Kevin Smith movies, and this one is really miles away from his other films I had seen -- ""Clerks"" (loved it), ""Mallrats"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (kind of sophomoric and cliched).

Ben Affleck plays a comic book artist who falls in love with another comic book artist (Joey Lauren Adams), who happens to be a lesbian. If you're thinking that's not a recipe for a happy end, you're right -- but the reason it's not a happy end may be a surprise.

One of the film's best features is its use and examination of some straight and gay stereotypes to look at the actual emotional content of human sexual relationships. It doesn't necessarily do this in an incredibly sophisticated way, but it's still insightful and entertaining.

I was pretty impressed overall with the story, the dialogue, the acting, as well as the fact that this movie was made for just a quarter of a million dollars. In all, it is a good example of a cheap, story-driven, Miramax-style film that has something to say, combined with Kevin-Smith-style (i.e. sometimes pretty crude) comic relief.

The DVD extras are practically all taken from an earlier Criterion Laserdisc issue. They include a commentary by about six people involved in making the film, including Smith, Affleck, and Jason Mewes (who played ""Jay""). There is also a set of deleted scenes and outtakes.

This movie is definitely worth seeing, but falls short of being a must-see. Recommended."
63,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"This is one I've been waiting for. But not at this price (currently $180.00). No way! The manufacturer/distributor needs to face reality. Even in a good economy, this would be overpriced. In our current condition, the price is nothing short of laughable. That said, I enjoyed the show tremendously and look forward to someday owning and watching it."
64,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I saw the print this DVD is based on a few months ago at the Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis. Kino has done more than anyone before to restore this great film. However, there ARE problems. The original score, for instance, was not always in synch with the action on the screen. That is due, no doubt, to the fact that the film is still missing much of it's footage. Therefore, the placement of the soundtrack must have been guesswork. And, frankly, the music itself is a weak and dated element. Kino should have commisioned the Alloy Orchestra to provide their outstanding version as an alternate. ..."
65,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"The video and DVD versions of this film are NOT the same as was seen in the theatres. Several minutes of footage were added that significantly altered the film, especially it's ending. It is NOT a Director's cut. It was probably done to assuage a cast member of the ""Deep Space 9"" TV series, whose contributions to this film had ended up on the cutting room floor. The original (better) version should have been available on this disc."
66,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Although a fan of South Park, I had never heard about this movie. Fortunately, a friend at work mentioned it (sounded promising) and later loaned it to me. Unlike so many comedies these days, it is funny and smart. No sacred cows... Now, please, put this out on DVD!!!"
67,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"This is a thorough look at Gaudi's work in Barcelona, with hauntingly beautiful music as it's backdrop (very little dialogue). It has some interesting extras but does not include an early film of Gaudi's work (by Ira Latour) which would have made it a definitive compilation of Gaudi films."
68,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Kino's first Blu-Ray release of a Keaton film included multiple music tracks, including a piano score. In more recent releases, though (including this one) it has only offered the jarring and insipid music of Robert Israel. During live showings of Keaton films in Minneapolis I have witnessed piano scoring (the best) and creative contemporary scores by local groups. A great musical score really helps to accentuate the strengths of the film instead of calling attention to itself. Israel's work is subpar and takes away from the experience."
69,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,ok
70,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,ok
71,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is one of those films that would normally put just about anyone to sleep, but Mike and the robots really make it fun with their commentary. They point out the obvious flaws and insert a lot of great jokes of their own. One of my favorite MST3K episodes, another being ""King Dinosaur."""
72,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, intelligently written and well cast. This is a film that is sadly underrated. I have just watched it again for the first time in years and was not disappointed. Supernova holds up very well as a top-notch sci-film and is highly recommended."
73,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I have to laugh at many of the reviews that state ""Part III is so much better that I and II!!""  It is the SAME as I and II, and is more over the top than the Phantom and Clones.  When I heard that Spielberg did some of the action sequences, I knew it.  Look at the ending scenes, they sum it all up.  When discussing the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin, the powers that be are were probably sitting around a table saying, OK, we will have them fighting an exciting light saber duel!  But, then maybe we should have some volcanoes in the background, yeah! and they should be erupting!  But then we should have the lava and rocks falling down all around them!  But then we should have RIVERS of molten lava flowing all over, and then we should have Obi-Wan and Anakin floating on little hover-discs above the flowing lava!!! YEAH!!!  And they should be jumping from disc to disc!!! HELL YEAH!!!! They just don't know when to stop, they're ADDICTED to special effects, pure and simple. Yes, I know Mr. Lucas says Hey, they are kids movies, I understand that, but these three new ones didn't do much for me, I personally feel part II was the best of the new ones (insert your incredulous comments here).  Let it suffice to say, these news ones don't hold a light to the original three.  And, if Jedi would have had Wookiees instead of little teddy bears--uh--I mean Ewoks, then the three original films would be 100% perfect.  Long live Star Wars!  Hey, this is just because I care, man."
74,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Well, what can I say?  I'm old, and I'm a parent of a 13 year old girl and a 15 year old boy.  I loved Disney cartoons back in the day.  I also had my kids watch them as they got old enough to (whatever the parent feels, but I waited a bit).  I understand that kids focus on the slap stick and the gags and such.  However, there is absolutely no doubt that the amount of smack talk, brattiness, smack talk, disrespectful attitude, etc, is rampant in the ""new"" films of today.  Fine, I understand that people say Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes were some of the most violent cartoons ever, agreed, but it is STILL different!  SO, I guess kids can get some fun off of these, but I would wait until they were older as the negative outweighs the positive messages of the film.  Hey, this is just because I care man.  cheers."
75,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This was Terrance Stamp's first starring role, soon to be followed by ""The Collector,"" another classic. This particular DVD contains a wonderfully cleaned-up version of the film plus a narrative by Stamp himself, something no other version has. It's a black and white film that will make you hate Robert Ryan and fall in love with Stamp as the personifications of evil and innocence. The heart of the story is what happens when pure evil and pure innocence clash.

I warn you, have a hanky or two close by as you will definitely need them. This is one of my all time favorite films and this DVD is the best edition on the market. Get it!

P.S. -- Despite the tag, Gregory Peck is not in this film."
76,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet!  I think this is the best 80's Bowie video.  If you like Bowie, then you will LOVE this.  In this concert, Bowie and his kick-ass band play through a great song set.  His band includes the excellent Carlos Alomar on guitar, who comes out in the first couple of minutes and shows where Steve Vai and Joe Satriani got their ideas from, Carmine Rojas on bass, who along with the drummer, lay down incredible rhythm for every song, and of course, Peter Frampton, whose guitar is just excellent song after song. Bowie and Frampton are old school pals, and they used to hang out and play music when they were teens, where Bowie says Frampton was already an excellent guitarist--Bowie brings him along and kind of brings him back into the game here, and he delivers. Bowies vocals are incredible throughout.  He and a cast do try to do some theater/drama stuff, which sometimes is really cool, and sometimes kind of corny, but who cares?  It is the music that matters man.  enjoy."
77,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Just thought I'd put in an updated request for the DVD.  This way someone at the studio will notice this and tell their bosses to put this out.  They are looking at these requests right??  Or, maybe they're all busy planning the next Gigli, Catwoman, or the like.  As long as I'm here, might as well add that this is a great thriller, filmed in the incredible settings of Southeast Alaska, and, it has THE MAN himself starring.  Nuff said."
78,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I don't know why I do this, just because I'm a Zepplein freak I guess.  I just can't let another ""Zeppelin weren't very good this night"" comment slide.  People who write that just don't know what they are talking about, period.  Yes, we thankfully have the new DVD, and the West Was Won CD, but to say that they couldn't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE.  To be fair, YES, there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that, and there is the ""fantasy"" footage that may or may not bug you.  BUT, there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory!  The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC, Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere, who knows where!  Anyway you cut it, the band is in AMAZING form, pure and simple, and if you are unable to be moved by this performance, that is ok I guess, but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other ""brilliant"" ""artists"" of the like."
79,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I missed this movie when it came out, so I'm delighted that I finally came across it. It is a wonderful fairy tale that, like all good fairy tales, contains moments of fear, love, joy, despair, horror, reality and hope. The special effects are fantastic, as are the script and the acting. The Jude Law character, ""Gigolo Joe,"" seemed a bit out of place, as did the glaring, blatant sexuality of Rouge City and the Flesh Fair. I'm not sure why Spielberg felt he needed to take the story to those extremes when he could have gotten his points across in a much gentler way that would be more suitable for younger audiences; I would be reluctant to take a younger teen or pre-teen to see this film for these reasons. I think the base-line story would be inspiring for younger audiences, however. Heck, I'm 62 years old and was inspired and touched by the film.

I highly recommend it as a sci-fi story and a very human story ... about robots."
80,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,Everyone needs to hear this information.  I found it interesting and alarming at the same time.  It should cause us to stop and think about what we are believing and doing medically.  This man is very thorough and provides written proof of what he teaches.
81,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This was a great series. The DVD is great but you should know it has a few shortcomings. The theme music as aired on Cartoon Network is great; the theme music on this particular DVD collection is totally different as it is a rather irritating rock tune that isn't very good (all episodes have this bad opening music). Finding the extas, for what they are worth, is difficult. When the opening menu comes up, you have to use the down arrow to see the extras and audio choices. The commentary by the writer, director and a couple cast members is a typed script you have to read and is spread across the four discs. The commentary is not very enlightening, especially when they reference particular episodes of other (much older, all the way back to ""Ultraman"") Japanese TV shows. If you don't know those shows, these references go right over your head. The trailers are for other anime programs, not this one. Apart from these ""gripes"" I've just stated, I love this DVD set. As long as you don't miss the theme music too much and have low expectations for the extras, you'll love this set too -- and you'll want the second season complete. Looks like there will be no third season, so there don't expect the many, many loose ends to be tied up by the end of season two as they aren't."
82,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"I thought was nice movie but sad ending, seemed magical though the prospect of being in love together and in love forever..she was stupid girl or he was stupid to be bipolar to her he stopped her from drinking water urgh then wanted her to ok then you're gonna be single forever bipolar guy"
83,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I've seen all 10 films; this was one of the best, but it suffered from a slow and talky middle. I actually fell asleep briefly during those segments! And, the story itself is cribbed more than a little from ""Wrath of Khan"". A LOT of similarities. Tom Hardy was not convincing as a Picard clone. Lacked the charisma and gravitas of Patrick Stewart. The Data story was pointless and a distraction from the main story. The look of the film was outstanding. Special effects, set design and makeup were all top-notch and convincing."
84,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Connery wasn't sure he understood the proposed script for this film when he first read it, but after passing on scripts he found incomprehensible, like ""The Matrix"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" he still agreed to take part in this super-ambitious project. Thank goodness! It might have had a lesser budget if he'd rejected the script, and the acting certainly would have been diminished greatly.

All the stars do an excellent job but, to be totally honest, the special effects (a combination of blue screen, miniatures, some of the largest sets ever built, and in-camera mixing) often steal the show in a wonderful, breathtaking way.

This is a must-see movie, and that's coming from a guy who has not been overly impressed by most of the ""super hero"" films of recent years. The makeup is also incredible, particularly for the dual Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde character. Nina Harker, the subdued and proper 19th century lady, transforms spectacularly into a vicious vampire leading a hoard of vampire bats. Connery, as Allen Quartermain of ""King Solomon's Mines,"" is cool and great without the need for transformation. Dorian Gray, played by an actor who looks a bit like Johnny Depp, displays some impressive changes as well. Tom Sawyer seems an odd choice for a film that includes Capt. Nemo, the Invisible Man and the other fictional hero/anti-heroes mentioned above, but he fits in well as the chosen successor to the elderly Quartermain.

Nemo's gigantic submarine, his elegant super car, the destruction of Venice and other eye-popping visuals aren't easily forgotten.

This is one of my favorite films!"
85,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"First of all, are we all in agreement that the books (the first four anyways) are BRILLIANT?? Yes.  That said I of course did not have my hopes too high for this film, however, as the release got closer, I started really feeling like they had better have done a decent job with this.  I mean come on, the material is too high quality to screw up as long as they stuck with it.  The result?  They did a good job.  I saw elements from the movies Brazil, Monty Python, Soylent Green in this film, maybe even Day of the Dolphin, and that is a good thing.  A few of the highlights for me:

1.  The dolphin footage from the beginning was fantastic!

2.  When Ford & Arthur get picked up by the Vogon ship, and they show it from their perspective i.e. from ground to interior of ship, was incredible.

3.  When Arthur sees his home devastated while the workmen start freaking out over the Vogon ship was excellent.

4.  The nature footage of the ""new"" Earth was simply beautiful.

5.  The ""sighing"" doors, I've GOT to get myself a recording for my doors!

I could go on, but for the ending, I think they should have said, ""ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW SHOULD READ THE BOOKS!""  I'm very curious to see whether we'll have a second installement of the film, if it is as good a quality as this first film, count me in.  UPDATE: OK, I've watched this a few times now, and I'm updating my review to FIVE big stars, this movie is FANTASTIC, pure and simple.  Any nitpicks I had about casting or whatever is superceded by the brilliance of the picture, ENJOY!"
86,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I found this show quite by accident while channel-surfing and immediately became a devoted fan. Great cast chemistry, quirky humor, exploration of relationship issues, etc. However, I feel the quality of the writing declined somewhat after the first season as it took on more of a soap opera feel. But, that said, it was still better than anything else on TV at that time and I eagerly await a DVD release."
87,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Ok, two things here, first, the good.  Supposedly the budget for this film was $65 million, if that is true, I am shocked that the picture could look this good for that relatively low amount.  When was the last time Hollywood did anything cheaper?  Maybe this could be a changing point in the $150 million film with the $35 million advertising budget--insanity.  Maybe Catwoman and others will add fuel to this idea. (yeah right)  The Bad news, what is it with these directors who think that they are bigger than the story?  Screw them.  It must have something to do with them thinking that they can't just make the movie of the book, or the comic, or whatever, they will somehow not be an ARTISTE, if they just copy the Alien vs Predator comics.  It is that, or, the other possibility is that these directors think that their ideas are actually BETTER than the material they are turning into a movie.  Isn't this where we get the ""The book is always ten times better than the movie"" saying?  I think that is what you have here.  The movie isn't as bad as the hard cores are saying, BUT, a chance was missed here to make a film that could stand with the first two Alien and first Predator movies.  Oh well, if it makes enough money, maybe we can see more, especially at $65 million. That being said, I didn't think this movie was as bad as the bad reviews said it was, I did get enjoyment from it."
88,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.

I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the ""Charlie Rose"" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.

Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.

I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!"
89,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Just saw I Am Legend.  I enjoyed it.  I had heard years ago that they were going to remake Omega Man with Arnold Swarzenegger, and guess what? A bunch of zombie movies started springing up all over the place (Dawn of Dead remake, 28 days, Shaun of Dead, etc), but I never heard anything about Omega Man again---until, I heard that they WERE actually going to do it, but now call it by its original title, I Am Legend, and the biggest box office star in the world, Will Smith, would be the lead.  If they would have made this film back during Arnold's heyday, I think it would have been successful.  But, later on, not so much, BUT, with Smith in it right now there is no doubt this movie will be a huge moneymaker.  The comparisons to Omega Man with one of my all-time favorites Charlton Heston?  Well, I like that the ""creatures"" are more intelligent in Omega Man, not just pure monsters out for food.  I think most people agree that out of Heston's ""post-apocolyptic sci-fi trilogy--Planet Apes, Soylent Green, and Omega) Omega hasn't weathered as well.  But, I think some of the best scenes in Legend are almost taken directly from Omega Man.  The driving alone through the deserted city, and some of the ""cracking up"" scenes with Heston, especially the telephone/booth scene is better that Smith freaking out about the empty city.  The ending scenes are quite powerful from both films, but I prefer Heston's ending as well.  So, I guess if you like scary/horror/action films, you should check out Legend.  And then maybe you should watch the Omega Man and the original with Vincent Price.  IF you don't like this stuff, then don't waste your time."
90,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Ken Burns doing Frank Lloyd Wright. Expectations among fans of Wright's work were very high. But Burns fell woefully short in capturing the essence of the man and in explaining what makes his architecture great (and what makes the ideas behind it still relevant today). Instead, he spent too much time delving into personal scandals, as if the docu. was being made for the commercial networks rather than PBS! A mediocre effort."
91,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,Cute story influenced by the famous book of the same name.
92,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,Television production values; Brett didn't measure up to Rathbone's portrayal of Holmes.
93,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This black-and-white BBC television documentary captures scenes and interviews from the making of Decca's ""G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung"" by Sir Georg Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic in Vienna in 1965 -- the final recording in Solti's Ring Cycle. The documentary does not cover any of the other operas in the Cycle, just G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung. In addition to the original television recording, clocking in at 88 minutes, there are also 69 minutes of remastered audio highlights from the entire cycle.

I really enjoyed the documentary and its look behind the scenes at what many regard as the greatest recording ever of the complete Ring Cycle. The tremendous time and expense of making the recording are apparent. It made me wonder whether any record companies would be willing or able to put this kind of care and investment into productions today.

Solti says in an interview that the schedule called for a minimum of 15 minutes of completed recording every day. The documentary shows examples of the process of takes and retakes, honing the sound of each passage until perfect. The producers also took costly steps such as the manufacturing of new Stierhorns, which are used briefly in Acts 2 and 3 of the opera. (Presumably the same horns had already been used in Die Walk&uuml;re.)

It is also wonderful to see some of the opera greats of the day, including Birgit Nilsson and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, performing in the studio setting and speaking about the recording process -- not to mention doing things that are unthinkable today, like smoking! In fact, it seems the whole cast, crew and orchestra was smoking most of the time -- very strange to see today. The film gives a nice picture of the personalities and processes involved in these great recordings. Highly recommended!"
94,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,pretty good sorta funny I remember enjoying watching these as kid
95,A7H20K09VIXXT,"I just watched this movie and I had to force myself to see all of it.  Lt. Col. Hal Moore's (Mel Gibson) speaches were syrupy sweet melodramatic drivel.  In fact, much of the dialogue is the same way. This film had none of the reality Platoon had, which is the most comprehensive Vietnam War movie.  We Were Soldiers is a very sanitized and fictionalized version of the Vietnam War. In addition to Platoon, I would recommend, Tigerland, Hamburger Hill, and Full Metal Jacket."
96,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Ok, don't go looking for a home run here, if you do, you'll probably be disappointed.  Just like with most remakes, if you were around when the original came out, and you really liked it, when you hear that there is going to be a new version coming out you say WHY???!!!  Just wait until they redo The Matrix, or The Titanic, or Pyscho, oops.  I just really enjoy this film.  Madonna does a great job of being the total rich bitch, looking down on anyone below her.  The ship-wrecked scenes are really good, and the music that is used as the two companions while away the sunny days just really gets to me for some reason--it really makes you wonder what it would be like, or it did for me anyways.  Obviously they are ship-wrecked, but it seems like paradise!  I also find the relationship development to be very interesting as well.  cheers."
97,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"While I watched ""Faces Death"", I felt that it was a much lighter version than I what was used to. So, I paused a scene and went hunting for my Key Video of the movie. I put it on and went to the matching scene, then switched back and forth between the VCR and video images. The difference was very pronounced. The Key Video version was darker, moodier and had deeper shadows. I don't know which version should be considered the ""better"" one, but they are indeed quite different! I enjoyed the commentary and booklet, but, like others here, would have liked to see more (such as the trailers). Overall, though, I am thrilled to see the series on DVD and will buy the next two volumes."
98,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I didn't see this series until it was in reruns. After a few episodes, I was hooked. The acting is the best, the special effects and makeup are excellent (especially in light of the small budget of the show), and the overall storyline is excellent. That overall storyline was greatly influenced by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, which I noticed more and more after the first season, but I'm a writer who has published a lot of Lovecraftian tales; the viewer isn't required to know anything about Lovecraft to follow this series. One of the later full-length films is blatantly a take-off on Lovecraft's ""Call of Cthulhu"", only it is set in space.

Some episodes fall short of the typical level of script quality, but generally the episodes are darn good and then some.

Trekies don't seem to take to this series, but I think it is great. It has spiritual undertones about the mystery and meaning of life and even good and evil; it speaks to the thinking viewer. It's not that ""Star Trek"" didn't appeal to thinkers, it just did it in a different way. I like both of these shows, but I prefer ""Babylon 5."""
99,A2A4GWAEM3VOW0,"Scott Hamilton has always been known to dazzle audiences with his incredible skill, artistry, showmanship, and pure love for the sport of figure skating. This DVD is the perfect blend of all of those elements. Not only is the showed compiled of some of the most well-known and talented skaters in the world such as Jenni Meno, Brian Orser and Jozef Sabovcik, but the show is also beautifully accompanied and orchestrated by musical great Michael Feinstein. Feinstein is also joined by actress and sixties pop great, Darlene Love. What makes this show all the more amazing, besides the roster of incredible talent, is that it is completely live. The electricity of all the performers seems to radiate through the screen and you can just feel the energy of all of these performers, performing to a live audience. The DVD also includes special behind the scenes features such as interviews with the artists and artistic director, rehearsals and a special inside look on the creation process of the show, which blew me away.  This DVD is a must have for skating fans, music fans and anyone who enjoys good show!!!!!"
100,A2A4GWAEM3VOW0,"I was surprised to see how completely captivating and intriguing this film was.  If art imitates life then this film is a perfect example. In this documentary, director Jamie Meltzer explores the bizarre and fascinating world of ""Song Poems"".  In this obscure sub-culture, ordinary people with stars in their eyes are seduced by ads in the back of magazines promising fame and fortune for original songs.  For a price anyone can submit his or her personal, heartfelt, and often times very bizarre lyrics/poems to be recorded as songs. Yes, the subject matter is strange but I found myself touched by these people lives and completely fascinated by the inner workings of the business end of the song-poem world. What I loved about it was that it was so completely human. There should be more films made like this one. You don't need huge special effects or some grand subject matter, all you need is a good story."
101,A2A4GWAEM3VOW0,"If you missed this performance in August on PBS then you definitely need to check out this DVD. In this performance some of the greatest and most talented names in Soul gather together to put on an unstoppable show to celebrate the opening of the Stax Museum of American Soul in Memphis. Some of the unforgettable performances include Al Green performing two of his classics, ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Love and Happiness"", Solomon Burke and Sir Mack Rice doing the sultry and grooving ""Mustang Sally"", Michael McDonald performing ""On the Dock of the Bay"" and many more!!! One of my particular favorite stand out performances was the Bar-Kays and Chuck D from Public Enemy performing ""Soul Finger"". This is a an awesome treat for any music fan and a proceed of the sales goes to benefit the Stax Museum and their music out reach program, which I thought was pretty incredible. I definitely recommend it."
102,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"average christian film, but good to have  these around and collect these for sabbath watching sso yeaha ok so,,. .."
103,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I am a conflicted fan of Wilhelm Furtwangler. He really was one of the greatest conductors in the last century -- I highly recommend everyone listen to his music. At the same time, he served the Nazi regime as head of what amounted to the national orchestra.

Harvey Keitel plays Major Steve Arnold, who is assigned to prosecute the denazification case of Furtwangler, and to ""make an example"" of him. The Keitel character has come under strong criticism in other reviews here for his aggressive, some might say abusive stance in questioning Furtwangler, but I disagree. I think most of the things Arnold says to and about Furtwangler need to be said. It is not right to gloss over them, and they are not things that can be said over a cup of tea -- a certain amount of confrontation is called for.

I agree that the Keitel character is overly aggressive at times, and yes, he is curmudgeonly and essentially one-dimensional. But on the whole, I would say my only real objection to his interrogation of Furtwangler as portrayed in the film is that Furtwangler was not allowed to have counsel present. Other than that, the issues he raises are pretty much fair game. His job was to prosecute, and basically he did what prosecutors do.

I would be very interested to see a film about what REALLY happened in Furtwangler's denazification proceedings. This is fiction, and that must be kept in mind. But also keep in mind that the denazification process in West Germany was a great success, mainly because the US took it very seriously. Germany benefited from the process, which surely seemed excessive at the time but has now resulted in a society that has accepted multiculturalism and diversity much better than most others in Europe. Sure, the situation is not perfect, but it's quite a bit worse elsewhere. This derives in part from the US's insistence in the late 1940s that ordinary citizens take a hard look at what was done.

Sure, the US didn't get it all right, there were mistakes and overzealousness, especially in areas like primary education. But overall, denazification was a wild success in West Germany.

It was was less of a priority in other places. This is true of Austria and a number of Axis countries that got stuck behind the Iron Curtain, notably East Germany and Hungary. The failure to look the past squarely in the eye 60 years ago still shows up in nasty ways in these societies today. Western Germany got it right -- and that in significant part because there were people asking the kind of questions that the obnoxious Harvey Keitel character asked, rather than taking the ""let sleeping dogs lie"" approach used elsewhere.

In this sense, ""Taking Sides"" offers a thoughtful look at two separate topics. First is the denazification era and the kind of issues that were dealt with -- it is a very instructive, if simplified and specialized, look at the mood and mindset of the time.

The second topic is the heavy musical angle and an examination of Furtwangler specifically, which I think is a must for anyone who wants to enjoy his music. Furtwangler doesn't need to be condemned, and I do not wish to condemn him. But listening to his music, especially his wartime recordings, without considering their moral context seems a dicey proposition. Leading the Berlin Philharmonic was not a morally or politically neutral job in those times, especially given the propaganda role ""great German music"" played in the Nazi regime.

This movie does not give answers, but it raises the right questions for fans of Furtwangler -- and for that matter, Karajan, who had a much easier time, perhaps unjustifiably so, because his denazification proceedings took place in Austria and because he was not yet nearly as big a fish as Furtwangler.

For anyone interested in this film I also highly recommend the documentary ""The Reichsorchester"", also about the Berlin Philharmonic during the Nazi era. Chilling stuff, further illustrating the kind of political naivete BPO musicians -- and likely Furtwangler himself -- had about their role at the time.

And please don't get me wrong -- I love Furtwangler's work and actually sympathize with the man. I just believe the complexity has to be recognized, not glossed over.

I'm very glad Furtwangler was exonerated, but to suggest he should not have been subject to more than perfunctory scrutiny because of his outstanding talent is absurd."
104,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"i did not get it, it may have had symbolism but i fell asleep on it and it was too weird in general to be interesting at least for me"
105,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I'm sorry, those of you who said you skipped this concert just plain screwed up!  I caught this tour and it was unbelievable!  The energy was incredible, the performance was outrageous!  If you like Fleetwood Mac then I just don't see how you will be disappointed with this show.  Unless of course watching Lindsey just GO CRAZY on his guitar, John and Mic kick ass, and Stevie do her thing (yes, she's ""getting older too"") isn't for you, then skip it."
106,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,Just love this story its so special it acts like evangelists are good things like no other-and I am one so I thought that was so happy and receptive to be good influence like that-and its cool little short 70's quirky cartoon and since I was born 79 and it 78 haha its kind of cool to me
107,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,pretty cool Christian sitcom one of rarer ones ever made like highway to heaven and this is all I know of that are so I think is pretty cool idea-on these whats cool is that they really try to reach out to all types of  struggling people on these episodes-to try to inspire and relate very kind effort I think and hope people will discover them that are types that relate-their are stories about and for runways prostitutes aids all kinds of issues in life and these angels are assigned to try to help people and so its nice ideas in it
108,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"Definitely great movies deserving of five stars and more! These are the Marx Brothers' best films, including the great Duck Soup. Having read other customer reviews about how Universal ""slapped"" this set together, however, I was surprised how classy the presentation is on the surface. There is a nice booklet and an extras disc. What were they talking about? Well, the extras really are kind of lame. I mean, they are great, but they really have nothing to do with the films, and they are short -- just interview footage from much later. And truth be told, I didn't get any new information out of the booklet, either. So, if you are optimistic Universal will take another stab at this and invest more in remastering and providing extras that mean something, you might want to wait. I felt it was time for me to have these movies, and I couldn't find any evidence a new version would be forthcoming. I am not disappointed I bought this box set, which has some of the best comedies ever filmed. But Universal definitely did not go the extra mile. ""Jamison, take a letter to my lawyer..."""
109,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Well, this was a popular tv show back in the day----Holy Cow!!!  That Laugh Track??!!  It is the most invasive, abrasive, ridiculous, and UNNECESSARY ""effect"" ever.  Thankfully most shows these days have dropped the evil laugh track.  I watched a few minutes of 70's show the other day and couldn't believe how bad the laugh track was!  Horrible!!  That all being said, this show took awhile to grow on me when it was airing, but then I did become a fan, and mostly watched until the end of its run.  It is good for some laughs---Real laughs, not the stupid, fake, canned, ""laughs"".  cheers."
110,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This DVD is important to see at least once for anyone who wants to appreciate Leonard Bernstein's ""Mass"", because as far as I've been able to determine it's the only available performance on video. ""Mass"" is a performance piece, and the visual aspect is crucial to understanding the work.

I'm not going to say it's a perfect visual. The production seems dated. It's good, but not great. Still, it's the only game in town, so I'm not going to complain about it a bit. I don't have ready access to live performances, so I'll have to make due with this one.

Musically as well, the performance is good. I'd say the original Bernstein disc is better, but this is a perfectly respectable recording. The weaknesses are those of a lot of live performance recordings. The acoustics of the hall don't seem great, and the microphoning of the singers and the orchestra is kind of clumsy at parts. I felt like I was listening to microphones instead of singers and musicians a few times.

The work itself is a bit dated as well, but (1) in a good way, and (2) all music is dated when you really think about it, whether it's Beethoven, Vivaldi or Pierre Boulez. ""Mass"" premiered in September 1971, about a month before ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" premiered on Broadway. Watching the DVD I thought of the inevitable parallels with JC Superstar, musically (less so) but importantly in terms of themes -- looking for God and meaning with the inimitable, sincere naivete of the early 1970s.

Watching the DVD this time, I also heard predecessor moments in the music to works as diverse as ""Cats"" and Osvaldo Golijov's ""La Pasion Segn San Marcos"". Thematically, I also thought of the old 1960s-1980s television series ""Insight"".

This is a great work (especially the ""Agnus Dei"" and the finale, in my book). It completely deserves the attention it has recently received with the revival by Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony. I look forward to hearing that version, which I have not so far. But regardless of what audio recording we're talking about, listening to ""Mass"" is only half the experience. See it at least once, then go back to your favorite recording with fresh ears."
111,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I like this show a lot, although it took me a few episodes to appreciate it. The group who produced and put it together didn't make much, if any, money, but they had a lot of fun making it. The characters grow on you after a few episodes and the wiggly effect ceases to be so noticeable. The budget was very small, so they did their best and produced a fun show.

Coach McGerk has since gone on to transform into Bob of ""Bob's Burgers,"" so he isn't portraying an overblown, pathetic, irritating character anymore, something he was good at in this series.

Brendon Small, who plays the main character of the same name in this series, has since gone on to make ""Metalacalypse,"" which I don't care for at all.

Lots of extras on this and following seasons of ""Home Movies"".  I enjoyed seeing what Brendan looks like in one of the extra featurettes on disc 1 of season on; we get to see him as himself and in an actual home movie (basically a fake ad for TV) he made purportedly demonstrating (in heavy metal drag) how to play heavy metal guitar. There are other featurettes, like an interesting  interview with Loren, the producer who created ""Dr. Katz"" and ""Home Movies,"" and more. Loren provides all you need to know about the history of this series, how the cast came together, and about the laborious making of the show.

It's a classic show, all 4 seasons. It's not wildly hilarious, but the concept and execution are endearing. The cast, even the normally-intolerable (for me) Emo Phillips as a smart-mouthed bully, did a good job for this show. It grows on you!

It's not wildly hilarious, but the show is endearing. The aniIa ""Home Movie"""
112,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Wow, I mean WOW!!  What can you say?  Come on people, get off your butts and watch this!  Next time I look this up I want to see 100 reviews!  If you care about music, are passionate about it, love it, then this is for you.  This is pure Rock and Roll, pure energy, pure talent.  When something like this comes along it renews my faith in the youth, if they are putting this out, and kids are digging it, then all will be good.  There is no hype in the case of the White Stripes because it is all TRUE.  They are simply BRILLIANT.  Anybody who enjoys good rock and roll will be blown away by this.  Buy this!  And then go and see the tour the next time they hit the road.  Hey, this is only because I care man."
113,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I really enjoyed this follow-up spin-off of the ""Babylon 5"" series. Gary Cole (who is now doing voices for cartoons!) did a good job, and the stories are interesting. The Rangers series that followed this was a big letdown. If you liked ""Babylon 5"", especially for the great acting and character development, not to mention creative storylines, you'll enjoy this short-lived series too."
114,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,great
115,A37J1JXBFXI0YM,Loved the glick show....this is poorly written and not funny. Wow what a disappointment.
116,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"I did enjoy this film, however it was a little too much ""MTV"" stylee footage for my tastes--you know, where they cut every 2-3 seconds to convey ""maximum action"".  The Baja 1000 needs NO enhancement!!  What I wanted to see was more SUSTAINED footage of the vehicles in action.  Yes, there is some of that, but not enough.  Just like concert videos and other sports footage, WE WANT  TO SEE THE ACTION!!!  that means NOT cutting back and forth like a mainiac, hey, this is just because I care man."
117,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I tuned into this Japanese film on one of the cable channels late last night. I had no expectations as the description made it sound like a cheap knock-off from Japan. I ended up getting caught up in it and enjoying the ride. The copy I saw was in English at first, before switching to a little Chinese and a lot of Japanese (with English subtitles for the latter two, of course). I'd never heard of any of the actors, but I loved the hero, the heroine and the shady, elderly Japanese woman who helped them; all three parts were very well acted. The special effects were quite good and not at all cheap looking. I enjoyed the unexpected plot twist that came shortly after the middle of the movie; it made it a lot more interesting. The only thing that made me laugh aloud was when they showed the alien ""Dragga"" without its huge robotic suit; it looked like a small but faithful version of E.T., and it actually was trying to get home, though not trying to phone home. I decided this one error in judgment on the part of the filmmaker was not going to ruin the movie for me and, once that was accomplished, I really liked the film. It's fun and action filled, plus the characters are really believable. Check it out!"
118,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I write this as a longtime Columbo fan who has collected and watched all of the season DVD's released to date. The fact is that season five was below-par Columbo. It had one outstanding episode, ""Now You See Him"". The rest were mediocre and one was abysmal, ""Last Salute to the Commodore"". By rights, Universal should have packaged this together with Season 6 or offered it at a reduced price, but that studio continues to take advantage of the fans by gouging us, giving us ""Mrs. Columbo"" instead of decent extras, and showing a lack of respect and knowledge of the show itself by making blunders like listing Robert Loggia rather than Jack Cassidy as the star of ""Now You See Him""!"
119,A3G77LSZPLZ74U,"This is my first review of an episodic television show so I'm going to be as harsh as possible...Where I can!

To let you all know I am not a fan of the original Battlestar Galactic...in fact a lot of night time shows were missed, as I was busily being an employee and a student. I did see a few shows but was immediately turned off with the introduction of the ""monkey in the dog suit"" and the little kid....

Now I also understand that this BSG is a ""re-imagining"" of the original but we will address that issue later....

I've rated this BSG so high and here are my reasons why:

#1 -  Believable Characters

We, earthlings, are not yet on the run for our lives but the show properly portrays what some us would do if there was a way to escape our world's devastation.

The characters go to and physically have restrooms! (Oy, this coming from a Trekker!)

People also have ""potty mouths"" so frak this!

#2 - The stories deal with real moral issues

How do we deal with an enemy that looks, feels, a reacts like us?

How do we deal with finding out the person you thought you knew or loved was the enemy?

How do we deal with issues involving love, dishonesty, family?

Gee, this week's loss of pilots and vipers  is a loss of pilots and vipers!!!! ( No mysterious regeneration of pilots and vipers)

#3 - Believable technology

Being a science-fiction lover...the technology is believable in that it does have connections to what is in the realm of the real world...atomic warheads, the Galactica's layout, pilot's bunks, closing doors between rooms and sections etc. Oh, don't forget resources that run out!

Lastly the way the show is filmed. I really love the semi-documentary style of filming. The realty of  the scene is really enhanced and the viewer feels like they are a part of the action, not just the ""fly-on-the-wall""....

To finish, I have heard a lot of the older fans wishing to ""ban"" this version of their beloved show...Call it my Trekker attitude but it would be illogical fro them to do this as this ""reimagined"" version is actually very much like the classic version....The classic had an episode concerning running out of water...the classic had an episode  about running out of fuel...the classic had  an episode of a ""sharpshooter Cyclon"".....the classic had Apollo dating a ""lady of the evening""...the classic had a two-parter concerning another Battlestar (Pegasus)..the classic had the word ""frack"" and other vocabulary in it....the unfortunate thing about the classic was it was told in an ""80's"" form and although they did their best the actors, writers, directors of that time were restricted to that ages television morality laws and formula on shooting an episodic show...

Nowadays, there is a greater audience request for more realism in the shows

Fortunately for us this is a show that is syndicated which means bigger and better plots (Is Gaius mad or controlled by a chip - this has not yet been resolved) much more better special effects and more attention to detail by the writers and producers (Let's face it, they have to feed their families too!) who want this show to be successful and lastly, television channels willing to take a chance on story plots about rape, racism, honesty, and faith.

120,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,good
121,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"The first season of She Spies was a very entertaining, off-the-wall comedy. Think ""Naked Gun"" meets ""Charlies Angels"". The show drastically shifted gears for the second season, though (due to poor ratings perhaps) and attempted to be a straightforward action show. It just didn't work. Get the first season set and enjoy some good laughs and eye-candy."
122,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Wow, we've got some people that are hard to please!  Haven't you been exposed to the ways of Hollywood enough yet?  When there is something you LOVE, and they are going to make a movie out of it, how often is it incredible?  The VAST majority of the time you have to lower your expectations because the movie version IS going to be worse than the book, comic, etc.  Aeon Flux does a decent job of showing the cartoon in live action picture.  Does it do it justice?  Well, probably not, but is it a good science fiction movie?  YES, it is.  The next question has to be what sacrifices were made to bring this to the big screen, and are they acceptable?  If you like science fiction movies that deal with post-apocolyptic Earth, then I truly believe you will enjoy this.  Films like Planet of the Apes (old, not new crap), Omega Man, Soylent Green, Mad Max/Road Warrior, Wizards and the Matrix, if you like these I think you will be entertained, and may even really enjoy Aeon Flux.  If you don't like stories like those  mentioned, then you will NOT like this, and if you think the cartoon was incredible, then you may be disappointed in this.  Hey, this is just because I care man."
123,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"A friend of mine bought this DVD for cheap, found she couldn't keep up with the subtitles or complex plot, so she sent it to me after she'd watched only a few minutes of it.

I'm very grateful to her for making me aware of this DVD! This film is, admittedly, a bit difficult to follow at times as one tries to read the English subtitles as the quick-fire images stream across the screen. In a number of places, instant flashbacks indicate revelations essential to understanding the story. So it's a thinker movie one really has to pay attention to, and maybe you'll need to watch it twice to catch subtle but essential bits you previously missed.

Having said that, even if I didn't understand the plot, I'd have to recommend this film for its breathtaking visuals. The CGI and normal film footage (and god knows what other methods) are blended together beautifully. Scenes of thousands of identical robots marching destructively through a city, world-wide destruction as humans battle robots and humans battle ""neo-humans"". Some sequences are shot in high speed to great effect. One is often reminded of anime special effects, only here they are done realistically. The filtered colors and tints are blindingly beautiful even when they depict scenes of ultimate nightmare and destruction.

All-in-all, this is an incredible film that has an excellent, albeit rather dark, plot. But the viewer is required to concentrate in order to ""get"" the finer points of the story. The final scene is open for personal interpretation in its details, but the overall resolution is pretty clear. I highly recommend this movie for its fantastic visuals and, hey, admit it, it's actually GOOD when a filmmaker forces the viewers to actually pay attention and think as they watch the film. If you aren't willing to concentrate beyond the level of a ""Spiderman"" movie, however, you will probably only end up frustrated and with a headache if you watch this film. Personally, I love it!"
124,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Denny Crain. That's all that really needs to be said, but I'll add a few comments. Boston Legal is a show that everyone in my extended family just LOVES, from my 14 year old neice to my 88 year old father. It gets taped every week for those who had to miss an episode for one reason or another. The reason, I believe, is that BL talks about big ideas/issues of the day, but not with an obvious slant. Further, the show exhibits an offbeat sensibility which is refeshing and rare on network television. Finally, most of the characters (and the actors portaying them) have a lot of charm and an easy chemistry between them."
125,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Absolutely clever and hilarious takeoff of lots of cartoon series we watched as young teens in the early 1960s. Plus lots of TV and alternative music references from the '80s. I love cartoons (even at my age!) but rarely consider buying any for fear of tiring of them quickly. That has yet to happen with this and/or the second season of ""The Venture Brothers."" It's simply brilliant satire and great fun. The extras of the creators and cast dressed as some of the characters they to whom they give voice is fun (no sign of Patrick/Brock, unfortunately, anywhere except in the episodes themselves), the deleted ""scenes"" are just draft storyboard images and are thus not very interesting. The only negative I have to report concerns the episode commentaries (not every episode has a commentary, but you won't mind --trust me on this!). They suck. The guys (the creators) are obviously not into it, are bored, and are making the best of a chore-like situation. I have yet to make it through all the commentaries as I really don't find the guys' personal interchanges to be of any interest. Occasionally, one reminds the other they are supposed to be talking about the show, of which they do very, very little. Nonetheless, I do love the show in spite of the disappointing commentaries; I'm glad to have this and season two (and three when available)in my collection, regardless of any commentary."
126,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a great package, including the 2 feature films and the 35 min. animated short that was released between them. There are plenty of extras, commentary, etc. in this package as well. Diesel at his best, which is really good! I am looking forward to the 9/1/13 release of the next feature film, 'Riddick'!"
127,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Well, I still carried a bias against Kudrow from Friends, because I couldn't stand the Phoebe character.  My wife (ex) made me watch, and I did become somewhat of a fan of Friends, but never Kudrow/Phoebe.  ANYWAYS, now we have the Comeback.  She does an excellent job, across the board, period.  The guy playing her husband does a great job too.  One thing I read--and I agree with--is that this show was ""too early"" in that us Reality TV crazed fans aren't ready for shows that make fun of Reality TV, I think that could be true.  As a middle aged adult, I'm teetering back and forth on reality tv between this-is-the-dumbest-crap-and-holy-cow-how-can-we-watch-it and Hey, you know what, I actually get off watching Paul Sr. and Paul Jr. try to run a bike business!  So, yeah, I'm not immune to the ""charms"" (snake?) of reality tv.  Of course, I end up actually fast forwarding often because it is just too much of ""watching a car crash"", and I try not to go there.  SO, back to this show, smart, witty, very well acted, good social commentary, watch it make fun of what we are all geeking out to nowadays, if you dare.  cheers."
128,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I ordered this and the more expensively packaged ""You Bet Your Life - The Lost Episodes"" at the same time. The ""Lost Episodes"" has 18 episodes, and this DVD has 14. ""Lost Episodes"" now costs $35 new, this one costs $7. The episodes on this are no worse than those on the more expensive set -- in fact there are some real classic moments:
- Tony Curtis's Hungarian mother, who plays with international chess Grand Master Isaac Kashdan.
- An idiosyncratic character who sings a song he wrote in Sanskrit.
- An attractive girl from ""Pakistan, India"" (my how times change!) offering a nice 1950s inter-cultural perspective.
- A guy from Jet Propulsion Laboratory who works on classified projects talking about his experience ""beating roulette wheels"".
- A fella who blows up a car tire inner tube in his mouth till it explodes.
- A beautiful nurse named Ina Anders who later went on to become a B-movie actress.
- And to top it all off, a 22-year-old Don Drysdale -- ace pitcher with the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, who would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Drysdale, together with Sandy Koufax, was part of one of the greatest starting pitching duos in baseball history -- and on this DVD, we see him win $1000 with his first wife. Unfortunately, Big D did not decide to go for the big question at the end of the show.

All in all, this DVD gives the best value I have found yet for your Groucho dollar. If they issue more of these, I will buy them."
129,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I see that Amazon is cross-posting reviews of ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" 1 and 2, so I'll just cover both movies here.

I am maybe typical of a portion of Kevin Smith's audience. I saw ""Clerks"", loved it, and have seen a few others (Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and didn't really love them as much.

But I must say I was surprised at how entertaining Smith is in these movies. The common points between Smith the director and Smith the public speaker -- or maybe standup comic would be more accurate -- are the sophomoric humor, cheap sex jokes and gratuitous swearing. But these things often seem forced and contrived in his movies, where they are likely to be delivered in stilted dialog right out of the George Lucas school of ""no one talks like that"" screenwriting. In person, however, he actually turns out to be a naturally gifted and engaging speaker. If you can manage not to be offended by his sometimes offensive humor, Smith is incredibly charming, likable and funny on stage.

The first movie, ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" was filmed at five or six different universities, with excerpts from the various shows spliced together into a four-hour movie spanning two DVDs. His half-hour take on a disastrously weird attempt to film a documentary for Prince is one of the most fascinating and hilarious things I've seen, and his recounting of a time working on a script for a Superman movie is also fabulous. His excruciatingly detailed account of how he met and first had sex with his wife may not be for the faint of heart. But as these topics suggest, Smith doesn't limit his talk to his own movies -- which means that even if you're not a fan of Smith the director, you might find some very enjoyable moments from Smith the speaker/standup comic.

The second movie, ""An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder"" was filmed in Toronto and London, and here the shows are presented on separate discs, not spliced together. It is more of the same idea -- Smith talking about his work, his life, Hollywood and anything else people can think to ask him. In Toronto, one of my favorite bits again was his follow-up explanation of the fallout from the Prince narrative on the first DVD set. The London show on disc 2 really had some of the funniest moments I've ever seen. I was laughing harder than I have in some time.

These movies have put Kevin Smith into new perspective for me, and I'm going to watch his other movies now. I actually grew to like him a lot more by watching these. This might not be the case for everyone, especially people offended by swearing and sometimes gratuitously sexual humor."

131,ACZSAM5ZA37SP,"This is the first movie I watched on my HD-DVD player and I think it was a good choice. I was disappointed in the first couple of minutes with the video as it didn't look that much better than regular DVD. Once they went outside that changed. They skies were clear blue and it looked awesome! The sound was great, gun shots sounded very real. As for the movie, I thought it was very good, but not quiet in the class of Goodfellas."
132,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Beautifully drawn, creatively plotted, clever, intelligent and funny, engaging characters that repeat so we can learn their entire story. Lots of very subtle and very obvious references to '70s and '80s popular new wave/rock musicians. David Bowie, Iggy Pop and (the late) Klaus Nomi appear as characters in the series even. It just gets better and better. Season 3 is great too, so I can hardly wait until it comes out on DVD in late March of 2009. THE BEST ANIME AROUND!"
133,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Mchale's Navy was well written and consistently funny, but the cast is what really made it shine. A few years ago, while travelling in Italy, I happened across this show on television there, dubbed in Italian. Although not being able to understand a word of it, I watched all the way through because seeing those actors playing off each other so well was entertainment enough! This DVD set will be a welcome (and well-used) addition to my collection."
134,A3M3HCZLXW0YLF,"Overall, a satisfying saga, with great acting. Too graphic for children, but the sexual scenes bring to light how privileged many are these days to not have to degrade themselves for theirs' and their children's survival.  Humans do that stuff, and this is a story about humans, after all.  I would also presume, however, that Mrs. Bryant didn't have baby formula, baby bottles, and sterilization equipment at her disposal, so if we were so into the realism, why was she never shown to be breastfeeding her wee ones? A little hypocritical if you ask me.  Mary Bryant was a courageous woman, whose love for her children knew no bounds. If you are afraid of strong women, move along."
135,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I am very glad to have found this film, which provides the kind of definitive documentary of Maria Callas I had been hoping to find. Because it was filmed 30 years ago, it contains plenty of first-hand accounts of Callas and her life by people who knew her, worked with her, or were her friends.

The director repeatedly depicts her life as a struggle between ""Maria, the woman"" and ""Callas, the artist"". I was tempted to dismiss this as a rather facile storytelling device until late in the film, when her secretary says that Callas herself used this contrast all the time. She would talk about her stage persona as ""La Callas"", as if it were another person.

This ""Maria vs. Callas"" interpretation goes a long way toward explaining the tragedy of her life -- starting as a talented singer with an unusual voice, but a very overweight woman who never experienced true love or passion. Her most successful period as an artist was before she left her husband, Giovanni Battista Meneghini, in 1959 after starting her affair with Aristotle Onassis. With Onassis, the woman blossomed but the artist suffered. Then after Onassis abandoned her suddenly in favor of Jacqueline Kennedy, the woman was devastated and the artist never performed again at her earlier peak levels.

The film is filled with insightful interview footage. I particularly appreciated the comments by her secretary and by Franco Zeffirelli. The film contains quite a bit of footage of Callas, but in general it is from later in her career and from concerts rather than operas.

The one exception is limited footage from ""Tosca"" in 1964, which was filmed for the BBC. That is a shame, because what set Callas apart was not her voice, but her acting and dramatic presence. Callas herself acknowledged that she sometimes wished to have the voice of Renata Tebaldi instead. Unfortunately, there is not much film out there of Callas in performance.

But in the end, this isn't a performance compilation, but a documentary. All in all, it's a great one. Highly recommended!"
136,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"A friend of mine bought this DVD for cheap, found she couldn't keep up with the subtitles or complex plot, so she sent it to me after she'd watched only a few minutes of it.

I'm very grateful to her for making me aware of this DVD! This film is, admittedly, a bit difficult to follow at times as one tries to read the English subtitles as the quick-fire images stream across the screen. In a number of places, instant flashbacks indicate revelations essential to understanding the story. So it's a thinker movie one really has to pay attention to, and maybe you'll need to watch it twice to catch subtle but essential bits you previously missed.

Having said that, even if I didn't understand the plot, I'd have to recommend this film for its breathtaking visuals. The CGI and normal film footage (and god knows what other methods) are blended together beautifully. Scenes of thousands of identical robots marching destructively through a city, world-wide destruction as humans battle robots and humans battle ""neo-humans"". Some sequences are shot in high speed to great effect. One is often reminded of anime special effects, only here they are done realistically. The filtered colors and tints are blindingly beautiful even when they depict scenes of ultimate nightmare and destruction.

All-in-all, this is an incredible film that has an excellent, albeit rather dark, plot. But the viewer is required to concentrate in order to ""get"" the finer points of the story. The final scene is open for personal interpretation in its details, but the overall resolution is pretty clear. I highly recommend this movie for its fantastic visuals and, hey, admit it, it's actually GOOD when a filmmaker forces the viewers to actually pay attention and think as they watch the film. If you aren't willing to concentrate beyond the level of a ""Spiderman"" movie, however, you will probably only end up frustrated and with a headache if you watch this film. Personally, I love it!"
137,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The director, Korea's most popular comedian, decided to realize his dream of making a high-tech sci-fi/fantasy film with a budget Hollywood would scoff at. His sincerity and years of intense effort paid off. He took a Korean legend, added to it, and went to several big shot American effects people, soundtrack writers, sound man, and the City of Los Angeles, asking them to help him make this film. He wanted it to be the best and most expensive sci-fi/fantasy film Korea had ever made, and the clips he showed in the U.S. convinced the people he needed to help him for a fee WAY below their usual. He built his own studio, invited experts and amateurs alike to help him put this together, and he realized his dream. The animatronic creatures (more than just dragons here!), CGI and miniature buildings are really well done. No, it doesn't look like a Godzilla film! The American actors (most of the cast, and it was made in English) are not all that scintillating, and the details of the storyline are a little shaky here and there. But all-in-all, I enjoyed the film and recommend it. The first part is a bit slow, but once the dragons and other creatures are released, it's great fun. How the director ever talked the city of L.A. to allow him to film tanks in the street after 9/11 is a mystery to me and, judging from the bonus feature, to the director, but he did it! I particularly like the giant snake-like dragon climbing up and around a skyscraper.

Just sit back, enjoy the excellent special effects and the beasties!"
138,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Actually, at the time of this writing, five of the six films in this enjoyable series have been released; the sixth and final film is currently in production and is scheduled for release in 2015. I will definitely add the sixth film to my DVD collection that already contains the first five.

As a published horror author myself, one who has little tolerance for zombie stories/films, I have to admit these films are an exception. Much of the credit goes to Milla Jovovich as Alice, the lead in all six films. The zombies are always there, but the acting is excellent and the storyline intriguing. The supporting actors are nearly all great too. Sorry Oded didn't make it to the fourth film as there seemed to be a budding love interest between him and Alice.

As to this trilogy of the first three films, the first is not in the same widescreen as the other two, but I didn't notice any difference, thus I don't regret getting the three as a set. The extras are all included for each film as well. Not to mention it's cheaper to buy the three DVDs together than separately.

This is a good deal and the movies are worth watching again, despite parts being familiar. I enjoy this series and hate to see it end. I'm sure Milla will do more good stuff, however. She is amazing! The only film she starred in that I really disliked was the Joan of Arc ""bio""; Milla's acting was great, but the film is depressing, ugly, dark and miserable to sit through (not Milla's fault, however!)."
139,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"This show was ""before my time"". I saw it in the early 70's when it was syndicated. I loved it then and still love it.

The title ""dates"" it unfortunately, but the stories themselves are not dated at all. It had an outstanding cast with really good chemistry. Thanks Shout Factory for bringing back this true classic!"

143,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"One of Chase's great roles!  Fletch was so great when I saw it, I loved the film, and it was quite popular.  Chase dresses up in numerous disguises, and the one that he was the ""roller skating guru"" I didn't even realize it was him.  I suppose if you're not a fan of Chase, or didn't know who he was, you might not be impressed with this outing.  Some of his references are also going to be lost on today's viewer.  However, the film is fun.  The follow up isn't as good, but if you like the first one, you'll like the second one too."
144,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a great movie about a young married couple who have a sexual problem -- he can only get excited when he gives it to her ""beneath the valley,"" if you get my gist. They try all kinds of therapies, she becomes a stripper, and she even has wild sex with him after slipping him a mickey; he isn't bright enough to recognize his own wife in the nude, her only disguise being a blond wig! Russ likes his girls BIG, and he later married Navidad, the star of this film. The husband in the film is handsome but dumb as a doorknob - yet funny! For me, Sister Ufalla Roof (sp?), the local radio evangelist tops the show when she saves the day by giving the husband ""solace and succor"" in her radio studio ""live"" on the air. She nearly drowns the poor guy. The gay dentist scene is pretty stupid, I must admit. The scenes that take place where the husband works are funny as heck.

Meyers was famous for being willing to show full frontal nudity on his females, but when it came to the males, he used dildos. In this groundbreaking film he breaks down and gives us a male frontal nudity scene that practically fills the screen! It's so unexpected, it cracks viewers up.

This is a classic! The sequel was never made, unfortunately, despite the notice at the end of the film. ""Up!"" was Meyer's next film. It's funny too but it took me a couple times to get into it. It includes gay sex and an old Nazi who loves to be beaten by a guy while a woman sits on his face, etc. It's really sick but done in a funny way. I highly recommend ""Beneath the Valley ..."" and with lesser enthusiasm, ""Up!"" Have fun you amateur perverts. These were originally X rated, but they are R rated now."
145,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This fun remake is really well done with exciting visuals, great cinematography, and fine acting. Spock has been reborn in Zachary; they look so much alike (when Nimoy was young, that is) that it is freakish. Be prepared for some changes, however, in that this film seems to take place in a parallel universe. Spock and Uhurah are fall in love and, apart from some rough spots along the way, carry their love connection into the second film.

The bad guys are pretty good too. Lots of great CGI explosions and emotional tension between Kirk and Spock as they get to know each other. This is a time travel trip, after all, taking the viewer back to what would be considered a prequel by most fans.

Enjoy!"
146,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"was a good version, better than older one maybe..pretty cool story about man on search for god and salvation and great symbolism in names of who he meets like evangelist-who sends him on the right path..the book is good too."
147,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This DVD has not, as far as I am aware, been shown on television. It is far superior to the vast majority of documentaries on the subject that do appear on TV, especially now that we are being bombarded by the totally unfounded Dec. 2012 Mayan end-of-the world predictions (legitimate Maya scholars all dismiss the prediction as nonsense -- the text upon which the so-called prediction is supposedly based is vague and does not warn of disaster, just social change).

The facts in this documentary are backed by the most respected experts in the field. So many others that purport to be of this excellent quality come nowhere near it. This is based on Michael Coe's classic, respected text on the subject, so you can't ask for much more. It has been updated with the author's oversight, so the info is fresh. It is also easily understandable for those of us who are not experts but still find the Maya and the Mayan glyphs fascinating.

A first rate piece that is well over an hour long."
148,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"For those of us with a sick sense of humor that is timely (refers to people and events in the news just recently) and funny and full of trash talk, this is it! This is the first set in the English dub new series of DVDs that is NOT censored. Thank you for that!"
149,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Watching this movie was like having a flashback for me. I knew Harvey, and at times I had to remind myself I was looking at Sean Penn in excellent makeup rather than at Harvey himself. I met Harvey when I was in my early 20s, before he immersed himself in politics; I lived in the Castro and frequently ran into him at Toad Hall (mentioned & recreated to some extent in the film) fairly often, although I barely recall his camera shop. I watched the Castro change and Harvey repeatedly fail in his bids for City Supervisor. And I can never forget the day he won, the shock I felt when I heard Supervisor Feinstein announce on TV that the Mayor and Harvey had been murdered at City Hall, the subsequent trial of Dan White, and the riot that transpired as a gut reaction to the verdict. This film recreates all of these events and times to an amazing degree of accuracy. I caught myself looking at crowd scenes, half expecting to see my young face flash by.

This is a very important film! One reviewer at Netflix said it was more of an excuse to show two men kissing than anything else. That's bologna! The director handled the brief and extremely tame sex scenes (NONE of which were enough to offend anyone, in my estimation; nudity in the film only consists of one brief shot of a naked male in a swimming pool, his butt shown for about 5 seconds under water and from a bird's eye view) cleverly and tastefully.

I wasn't a close friend of Harvey's by any means, but he had very unique ways of speaking, talking and flirting, all of which Sean Penn recreated to great effect.

The film gave me more insight into Harvey's personal life both in NYC and in San Francisco; I didn't know too much about that, although I saw Scott a few times. As stated in the film, he wasn't a saint by any means (he could be downright irritating and persistent in his advances when he'd had too much to drink, and that's based on personal experience), but he was a regular, even ""normal"" man who was in the right place at the right time with the courage to do what he deeply believed had to be done to save innumerable lives and change even more minds. One could easily compare him to Martin Luther King, whom I feel sure would have admired Harvey as much as Harvey admired Rev. King.

More people should see this film for its historical accuracy, fantastic script, direction and performances. It's a story for all people who are discriminated against for any reason simply because it's message is one of hope and the realization of that hope, despite the fact that getting to the latter far too often demands the supreme sacrifice."
150,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,good
151,AFTUJYISOFHY6,Seeing all the stars in the Christmas show brought back so many memories.  These were the days when you actually had to have talent to be a star.  Loved it!
152,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"These interviews by David Frost of Richard Nixon were very interesting, but failed to really pull me in until the last 20 minutes, when Frost asks Nixon to make three admissions -- of wrongdoing in the cover-up of Watergate, of abuse of office, and putting the US through two years of unnecessary suffering by not resigning earlier.

I won't give away Nixon's response, but it gets pretty powerful right up through the end. You can see that both men were overwhelmed by the moment. Frost is clearly shaken, even as he tries to manipulate Nixon into making a heart-rending admission, and Nixon looks at one point almost like he was in anguish and ready to give in. And in the end, maybe he does, for all intents and purposes.

A lot of the interviews up to that final question deal with the minutia of who did what when, and what Nixon knew on specific dates. Frost was hitting Nixon with quotes from transcripts, in a lawyerly fashion, and at one point Nixon acknowledges explicitly that Frost was playing the role of prosecutor. These parts of the interview were a bit dull for me as I'm not a Watergate buff. I used to know more about the details, but I have long since forgotten them.

Despite the high level of detail in spots, this is a great document and important for people to watch. Highly recommended."
153,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"They aren't funny at all. They get the occasional good guest star for a cameo, but after 4 or 5 min. of these guys, I am bored and nauseous. I cannot for the life of my figure out who or what keeps these guys on the air on TV or on DVD. I can't stand them or their ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" show either!"
154,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"The writing for Season 6 slipped dramatically. The best of the episodes were mediocre; the rest were awful. Watching these almost made me wonder if Garner really left the show early because of the poor writing rather than physical ailments, as he claimed. Thankfully, this wasn't really the end. Several of the TV movies measured up quality-wise and they are about to be released (half of them, anyway) in early November."
155,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I loved Bruce Campbell in the original ""Evil Dead,"" ""Evil Dead II,"" and ""Army of Darkness,"" but the movies he's starred in and now produces and stars in are really sickening. They are low-budget (and Bruce is hardly poor as he's one of the original investors in Renaissance Pictures and owns a HUGE piece of land in Oregon, on which this film was mostly shot), trashy, badly written, unfunny and lacking in good special effects or ideas. In an attempt to make fun of his own past, Campbell has the characters repeat his lines from the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness"" again and again. The acting is dismal and Bruce comes off as his ""Ash"" character every time, only he's older and heftier and less funny each time. I've seen enough and could not even sit through all the way through this groaner."

157,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Glad this is coming to DVD. It was very well written and the cast had a wonderful chemistry. SHOUT Factory has brought back a lot of gems of classic television; this is one of them. I hope that ""Dobie"" is on their radar. It also deserves a release!"
158,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The Shin Chan show isn't for everyone, just those of us animation lovers with a twisted sense of humor. I now own both seasons, parts 1 and 2 of each, and I want more! I don't think the ratings were that high on Adult Swim, but I hope they make more. It's been a while since the 2nd season ended, so I'm not sure if there will be more, but I for one enjoyed both seasons from start to finish. Only ""The Venture Brothers"" tops this show. I am also a fan of ""Robot Chicken,"" but I bought Shin Chan first as once these DVDs go out of print, they cost a fortune to obtain. I bought ""Invader Zim"" when the series was new, and now the prices for new copies of the entire series are through the roof! So buy all the Shin Chan you can, while you can-can, then you can enjoy his ""ass dance"" whenever you want!"
159,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I must confess I wasn't permitted to read super hero comics as a child, so I don't have the enthusiasm for Marvel, Stan Lee, and other related genre products that many of my friends do. I enjoyed the special effects of Spiderman (the recent big budget film), but the storyline was lacking. The Hulk movie didn't do it for me. But a friend urged me to check out the first Iron Man movie as he assured me Robert Downey, Jr. takes it levels above the typical super hero/comic-based films. And he was right. There are, as should be expected, moments that definitely require a suspension of belief, but I didn't mind them. I'm a published author of horror, sci-fi and fantasy, so I tend to look to the storyline and the characters above the impressive special effects. Both of the Iron Man films are enjoyable on all of these levels. The first one is my favorite, although it is difficult to state why that's the case, but this second film is quite enjoyable as well. I can assure you I'm looking forward to a third in the series; my only requirement is that Downey remain the lead in any further films as he adds something special to the role."
160,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I liked everything about this movie from the brilliant acting, direction, cinematography, script, editing and, of course the music. Dury was a tragic figure in many ways, rough and raunchy and wild with a ""unique"" singing voice. Actually, he always said he was more of an entertainer than a singer. His hit songs were great fun. Like most Americans, I didn't know much about his life. This film gives an inspiring view into the mind and music of a man who became a star despite his polio disability and his hellish childhood, not to mention trying to be a good father to his children, especially his son. He had two woman at the same time who both loved him and were both loved in return; they knew about each other and helped each other try and cope with the rebellious life of ""regular bloat who put on a wild, wonderful shows and made some unforgettably fun hits that were totally different from the other music of his time."
161,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This is a pretty brilliant film, managing to tastefully and touchingly walk the line between comedy and genuine emotional depth, all in a context of death and funereal ceremonies.

The main character, Daigo, loses his job as cellist in a Tokyo symphony orchestra when the orchestra goes out of business. He and his wife are forced to move back to Daigo's rural home town, and Daigo falls into a job as a kind of mortician. The film goes into some very beautiful and sometimes comedic scenes about Daigo's job, preparing the corpse for departure -- which really is a service for the benefit of the loved ones who remain.

In the process, much is learned about the nature of death, love and service -- and in general the meaning of life.

With beautiful music and cinematography to complement a wonderful screenplay, this lighthearted yet very serious study of unexpected joy discovered in life's dark times is not to be missed."
162,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"This is a very well done film.  Judge once again puts out a well done piece that dosen't seem to make much impact with critics and audiences.  Office Space and Idiocracy are so much fun, and Extract continues that.  Bateman is simply excellent in the lead role, perfect.  Mila has really grown on me, she was ""cute"" for the 70's show, but I'm glad to see her moving up.  One little nitpick I had with this was the ""stoner"" character.  Don't know who played him, but he was too much like a skin head meth dealer, loud, obnoxious, violent, etc.  Didn't seem like your friendly pot dealer dude.  Good to see Affleck trying this role out, I like the job he did.  So, overall, excellent film, the writing, acting, all very good.  cheers."
163,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Time limited the filmmakers from including a lot of bands in this film, but they did their best with only 2 or 3 real ""misses"". Great numbers by Wall of Voodoo, X, Toyah Wilcox looking and sounding her best (especially if you saw her in the film ""Jubilee""), Au Pairs, Dead Kennedys, the unforgettable by Klaus Nomi, the outrageous The Cramps, Police, and MANY more are recorded here during ""live"" performances. You'll be pleased to see good footage of bands you loved but have since forgotten.

This is not one concert, but a mix of great one-number-each, on-stage performances by many of the most outrageous and greatest bands of the time. There are, as I said, a few bands/artists who I don't care for and feel should have been replaced by better bands, but we all have different taste, which is what new wave was all about in the first place, a variety of styles and a willingness to experiment with new influences, instruments and mixes of styles.

Professionally filmed with no chit-chat, just one song after another. No other documentary of the time or the early new-wave scene captures so much of the feel of the time so well. I recommend it highly!!!!"
164,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,Putrid. Unfunny. Pathetic. I've seen lots of bad movies in my time (55 years) but this one put all the other bad movies to shame! Zero stars.
165,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This movie isn't all that well known, and the DVD is the ""rated version."" I don't know the difference between it and the ""unrated"" Blu-Ray version, but I doubt there's much. The three stars in this had a grueling job ahead of them, but they did a great job. They are sympathetic, likeable characters that grow on the viewer. The action never stops in this unexpectedly enjoyable movie. I've seen it on TV a couple times, but I finally decided to buy the DVD to add to my collection. I am a published supernatural horror author myself, so I'm pretty sick of vampires and zombies, but I like this take-off because it's different. The only zombie films I can bear to watch these days are the ""Resident Evil"" series. Give this vampire film a chance; you might be very pleasantly surprised by it.,"
166,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Yeah, listen to his music, it IS from the future!  If you are interested in art, in music, in film, then this is something that you need to watch, period.  Maybe you will get into his music, maybe not, but if you want to challenge yourself, expand your boundaries beyond what your parameters currently are, check this out.  Hey, this is only because I care man."
167,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"When season 4 didn't come out on schedule, I was upset! I wrote the production company via email (""Fan mail from some flounder.""), only to be told they were not going to do a 4th season as the first three seasons had not sold well enough. How could that be??? This is the greatest and most legendary cartoon series ever! I'm sooooo glad they changed their minds finally.

The ""Best of ..."" DVDs are, I'm sure, all well and good, but we who love and remember the show in its original form (or even in any of its subsequent formats) want it all!

I'm praying this season 4 sells really well so we soon see more seasons being released until we have it all. I'll buy every one! But please don't make us wait 5 years until the next season is released, which is how long we had to wait for this one.

No, there aren't any extras or subtitles on this season, but it's likely they ran out of extras to attach, and we can live without the subtitles.

We just want more of the seasons, with or without frills! And the packaging is still really fine.

I give this collection as a whole my highest recommendation! Get it today and buy a copy for a friend; if your friend has a sense of humor, he or she will thank you for it again and again!"
168,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Any fears that this superlative series would burn out after 2 or 3 outrageous seasons have proven to be unfounded; it's as great as ever and shows no signs of winding down.

Intelligent, clever, funny as hell, and full of surprises! I love it and look forward to more!"
169,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it. The writers managed to weave a seriously good Western story with a Sci-Fi tale and made it all work. The cast is excellent and the effects are top-notch. When the DVD came out without much fanfare, I decided I'd better get it before I forgot about this film. It didn't get much acclaim after it was released in the theaters, but it's a good, solid action/adventure work well worth pulling off the shelf every so often to enjoy again or share with a friend who hasn't seen it."
170,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"What a relief that this 5th season wasn't stretched out into a 6th, as now I have ALL the episodes of the best cartoon series ever made.

There are 33 episodes of R&B plus all the side bit and other character-driven chapters. I checked the contents of the 5 Complete Seasons against the listings in two books about R&B, and I thank the distributor for finally releasing the final two seasons after making us wait 5 years between season 3's release and the release of the final two seasons.

Excellent quality of picture and sound. Nice little boxes. Not a lot of extras, but after the extras on the first two season sets, there wasn't much left to include on these.

Hoorah, Hokey Smokes and thanks so much for restoring the original order and availability of this unbeatable series!"
171,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is literally the first animated cartoon series made specifically for TV rather than theatrical airing. I believe it was shown on ""Captain Kangaroo,"" although that may not be the first airing as I was born the year it was first released. It originally ran from 1950 to 1952.

Each episode is very short and the animation was cheaply done (lots of non-motion frames), the first several story lines in black and white, the later ones in color. The characters got cuter as the series progressed as well.

This was the infamously wonderful Jay Ward's first animated series. Unfortunately, he lost the rights to it to his partner in an ugly legal battle, the happy outcome of which was, of course, that Ward went on to create the legendary ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" series. Ward refused to discuss the initial series in the mid-seventies when I met him as he was still too upset about it; luckily I was able to purchase a hand-painted cell of Crusader that Ward signed only after I stumped him with a question about another of his series, ""George of the Jungle"". The copyright to the Crusader series was allowed to lapse, this distributor retrieving it from public domain.

Obviously, the adventures of Crusader Rabbit and his (Bullwinkle-like) Rags the Tiger is somewhat primitive and not as funny as Ward's later efforts. It's a wonderful relic, however, that fans of vintage animated cartoons will treasure.

Despite the notice that there are flaws in the transfer, the quality of the episodes on these three discs is quite good, both the visuals and the sound. The menu allows the viewer to skip through the episodes easily or watch an entire story line all the way through without interruption. All the episodes ever made are on this set.

I highly recommend this to collectors and anime historians that hasn't been available in decades apart from one story line (the Sahara one) released on VHS by a small distributor in the 1970s. It's a classic view of primal Ward humor."
172,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This movie is a real winner. It has a great story based on a wonderfully original plot device -- the existence of a Timer device, stamped into your wrist, that tells you precisely what day you will meet your soulmate, and actually rings when you meet him or her. But it can only tell you if your soulmate is also wearing a Timer -- which are sold in a stores in every mall, with monthly plans like for cellphones.

The timer of Oona, a 30-year-old orthodontist, doesn't ever start counting down, so she's getting nervous. Very nervous. Is it because she will never find ""the one"", or because he hasn't bought a Timer yet?

This is a romantic comedy, I suppose, but the comedy aspect is not the film's main strength. There is no slapstick, nothing raucous going on here. Rather, the film brings a science fiction sensibility into a very non-science-fiction context, using a non-existent technological breakthrough (a timer based on reading levels of ""oxytocin, the hormone of love"") to examine the nature human relationships. Does fate exist? Is there really a ""one"" out there for everybody? Or are free will and our own choices the important thing?

I liked the film's originality. I liked that even 10 minutes before the end of the movie, I didn't know exactly how it was going to end -- although I did suspect it wouldn't be tragic.

The music, by Andrew Kaiser, is also worth mentioning. Just what you would expect, and what the film needed, but brilliantly done. Lots of sounds like kitchen timers ticking, very rhythmic, but with an irrepressibly optimistic edge. Often reminiscent in mood and tone of the kind of music Annie Little makes.

It is a smart movie, well acted, with very likable characters. It doesn't tell you what the answers are, but it raises good questions. Satisfying all around and highly recommended!"
173,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"It's a shame this 3rd season is considered too over the top to be shown on cable TV; after seeing the Comedy Central Roasts and ""South Park"", I'd concluded there wasn't much that was too much for cable. After watching the first installment of this new season, I just don't understand why Adult Swim doesn't air it.

It's the same old loveable Shin in this third season. There's a bit more of the dark ""bunny"" aspect included in this latest installment, but that aspect is easily skipped by those who find it disturbing. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the new season and hope there are many more to come. The gang's all here from Ench to the teachers to the neighbors and the Shin clan of oddball characters. I really like and recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first two seasons. Shin's an acquired taste and not for everyone, but once a fan, always a fan!"
174,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I wish that I could give this 5 stars, but I can't. Too many of the films are in poor condition and require major restoration, which Kino is apparently unwilling to undertake. It's rather disingenuous of them to be offering this ""remastered"" set on Blu-ray when the source material so obviously needs help. A Harold Lloyd collection was recently released, fully restored. Buster Keaton is arguably a more important figure in silent film comedy and deserves at least equal treatment. Bad on Kino for not doing so."
175,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Just thought I'd put in an updated request for the DVD.  This way someone at the studio will notice this and tell their bosses to put this out.  They are looking at these requests right??  Or, maybe they're all busy planning the next Gigli, Catwoman, or the like.  As long as I'm here, might as well add that this is a great thriller, filmed in the incredible settings of Southeast Alaska, and, it has THE MAN himself starring.  Nuff said."
176,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"well, this is why we are all interested in these things isn't it?  There seems to be a even split between Office fans that the new season is terrible, or the new season is still good stuff.  I say it is good stuff.  I really enjoy Spader in the show.  The first four seasons are the best, pure and simple.  Then, while there are moments in seasons 5-7, there were more moments--for me--where it was just too cringe inducing to handle.  I guess to put my money where my mouth is, I own seasons 1-4, and I plan on buying season 8, not sure what I'm going to do about seasons 5-7.  So, if you didn't watch this season because Michael/Steve was gone, you owe it to yourselves to watch this, based upon all us diehards, it looks like there is a 50% chance that you are going to really like the show.  Hey, what else are you going to do?  Watch all the shows about crackheads, methheads, badass biker dudes, serial killer killers, dead guys, dying guys, zombies, and crime based shows showing us rape, child molestation, incest, torture killing, thrill killing--and all of the ridiculously pretty/handsome ""agents"" who are trying to solve the crimes etc, etc?  I say give The Office season 8 a spin, they've earned the right to try to move on without Michael.  cheers."
177,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Damn good show, got canceled before the season was even over, apparently Jersey Shores, Honey Boo Boo, and any of the other ""reality"" shows were considered superior by the viewers and studio suits.  Can't believe they even put this out on DVD, but thankful they did, check it out!"
178,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Ok, we all know that super hero movies are going to be ""popcorn"" movies, i.e. movies that are trying to put as much action, noise, explosions, maybe a few girls running around, etc into two hours.  These days (yeah, I'm showing my age) I believe that the movies studios are addicted to CGI and special effects, they just don't know when to stop, and just because you can do ANYTHING you want in a movie today, most definitely dosen't mean you should do it. (see Spielberg films, Transformers, et al).  SO, Captain America, in my humble opinion, does show some restraint on the ""popcorn"" front.  Is it a popcorn movie?  yes it is.  But it sure helps having one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, The Red Skull, superbly played by Hugo.  The other actors do a fine job, and there is a lot of cool weapons and costumes as well, the action is well done for the most part.  SO, I only own one super hero movie, the first Spiderman, now I will buy Captain America, cheers."
179,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"So much music on here, from so many sources.  Looking back on this I still can not believe that the Talking Heads sold a single record!  I actually saw them play live on Saturday Night Live in the late 70's, I just could not believe what the hell they were doing!  I kind of followed them after that, hearing a few songs like Life During Wartime from Fear of Music.  Then Burning Down the House became a monster hit, and they followed it up with the live video Stop Making Sense.  When I first saw the video, I just could NOT believe that it was real!  It was just the craziest thing I had ever seen.  Now this package comes out, and to get to watch video from so many sources is just really, really, special.  I wish I could have the ENTIRE sets from any of this sources!  It is going to take me awhile to internalize all this, the performances just show over and over that this band, The Talking Heads, is one of the GREATEST bands of ALL TIME.  check them out.  Cheers."
180,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Okay, so the actor didn't really look that much like Lincoln and actual history is really tinkered with in a big way. But consider the title! If you just watch the film for the fun of it, it is well done. I enjoyed the special effects and didn't worry about historical accuracy (for a change, as I'm usually a stickler for that!). It's a goofy movie based on a goofy idea, so just relax and enjoy. Don't expect too much from the film, but I did enjoy it."
181,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Great collection that includes all my favorite episodes from the Hal Roach years. This collection has really been cleaned up; most of the episodes are really clear with good sound and no missing pieces. Here and there the opening titles have no sound or are incomplete, but at least they didn't try and reconstruct the original titles with new footage. I really am surprised at the really good quality of some of these as I would have assumed they would be in pretty poor condition. Having checked out some other collections of the Rascals/Our Gang comedies, I rate this set as the best available."
182,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,I was totally mesmerized by this documentary. Fascinating stories and insights about Woody's life and his films. I was impressed by Woody's personal involvement (including visits to his childhood haunts) and by the interviews of a broad range of friends and colleagues who have known and worked with him over the years. The film clips were well chosen and convey the unique characteristics and qualities of each film. I am thankful that this documentary was made; it does justice to Woody's ongoing contributions to film.
183,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I thought was Christian film and so wasn't and wasn't even good regular film so dumb haha for real
184,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This will probably be one of Billy Bob Thornton's final films as he has stated publicly that he is pretty much done with making films at this time in his life. I'm sorry to see him retire, but he certainly has left us with a wonderful legacy of films that are ""a little different"" than the usual fare. This is one of those films.

There's a lot of violence in this film, right from the start, but it isn't gratuitous violence. The seemingly obvious plot soon reveals some very unexpected twists and surprises, which is great fun. Thornton isn't one of the main characters, but he is certainly unforgettable as a murderous, power-hungry tycoon who has diverse groups of thugs at his beck and call.

The real stars of the film are the seemingly rotten-to-the-core brothers who will do anything for money. They set out to do a high-paying job for Thornton, but they are transformed when they learn the job is the kidnapping of a young man who has severe mental and physical disabilities. This transformation is great to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie doesn't turn mushy as the carnage keeps things rolling at the pace of a roller coaster.

The acting is excellent, as is the script. I saw this without having any idea what it was about, just looking for another good Thornton film ... and I definitely found one here. I ended up buying it as well."
185,A16WO8T4YXGVWP,"I watched this movie back in the 90's when it first appeared, and even taped it.  Over the years, the tape deteriorated to the point it was unwatchable.  I've been looking for quite some time for a replacement and found it here on Amazon.

The video quality is about 7/10 and the audio 8/10.  That said, the lack of top quality does not detract from the movie itself.  The setting may be dated (90's computers, no cell phones, etc.) but the story of a driven woman who gives up her personal life for business success rings true even today.  Wendy Crewson, in on of her earlier roles, is excellent as Ebbie's personal secretary, Roberta Cratchit.  Yes, the lines get a bit hokey at times, but hey, it's Christmas and we all need a little hokey!

I simply love this gender-roles-reversed tale of redemption!!!"
186,A1KM9FNEJ8Q171,Strong characters. Excellent story lines. Great photography and costumes. Surprised at every turn of events. Can't wait for each new episode.
187,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"[Forgive me if I misspell some of the performers names.]

Dennis Quaid is a crazed author of a series of skits (and commercials for some reason) he is pushing (forcefully) to Greg Kinnear, a film mogul. This is the thread that runs throughout the entire film as a base theme. I was bowled-over by the cast of this film. I didn't know much about it until I saw it, but I enjoyed much of it. There are definitely parts that fall flat or even a bit lower, but more than 1/2 the film is so outrageous and over-the-top that it's damn funny. The writers definitely went for the sicko concepts, most of which they couldn't get on TV today, despite Seth MacFarlane, the king of bizarre/offensive humor being in the film as himself.

Hugh Jackman on a blind date with a beautiful woman in a fancy restaurant has a normal-sized scrotum growing under his chin. The poor woman tries to be cool, but it's pretty hard. That was a funny sketch.

There's a sketch about what could happen if home schooling were taken to the extreme that's pretty funny.

The skit with Hali Berri is weird funny. She and her date do some unthinkable things to themselves when they engage in a serious game of Truth or Dare.

These three sketches along with some of the segments that return to Quaid's increasingly forceful (guns and gernade anyone?) attempts to sell his script are the highlights of the film for me.

The late ""Tony Soprano"" makes a cameo as a security guard Dennis Quaid had to ""blow"" (against the guard's will no less) to get on the movie lot in the first place.

The fake commercials and final sketch about a black basketball team afraid to play their first white opponents have a few chuckles but don't really work very well.

This film has been compared to ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" a disconnected string of comedy sketches done in, I believe, the early 1980s, but this film is MUCH more amusing than ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" which contains only about 10 minutes of really funny material.

If you have a really twisted sense of humor like I do, you'll enjoy this movie despite its shortcomings. It's crass, gross and is rarely ""tasteful"" in the least. If that sounds like fun to you, give this film a try. There are parts you will definitely want to share with your friends as they won't believe you without proof. If you are more reserved in your taste, you might want to pass on this one."
188,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The special effects are excellent, as one would expect, but once again, Robert Downey steals the show with his delightful style. His humorous lines are effective without interfering with the serious storyline at all. He makes it fun. I hope there's another Iron Man film. Unfortunately, when Iron Man is simply one of a group of superheroes in a film, Downey is not able to carry the show, thus the end result suffers, so we don't need any more of those."
189,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a sweet film with gorgeous special effects. Franco in the lead is excellent, as are most of the other actors/voice-over actors in the film. It is a prequel to the original, although the two don't actually match up all that well. The story is good, the dialogue is good, and it is a very enjoyable film. The only things that really bothered me were having two evil witches (sisters), which seemed unnecessary and a bit confused, plus I thought the sister who played the green witch/Margaret Hamilton role, was a poor choice for the role. Her acting wasn't up to the part, and the look they gave her just didn't strike the right chord with me; I found her irritating.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it."
190,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"Sometimes when I watch a favorite television series from my youth, I'm terribly disappointed. It's dated, hokey or worse! Not so with Dobie. It's still fresh and very different from the standard fare of it's time. It was a well-written show and had a wonderful cast with great chemistry. I only wish that Shout had put more effort into the special features: a longer, more detailed interview with Dwayne Hickman , for instance. Commentaries on a few select episodes would have been welcome, too. However, the bottom line is that I'm thrilled to have the episodes (some of which I'd never seen before) in excellent audio and visual quality. What a treat!"
191,AFTUJYISOFHY6,When we were growing up we always watched The Hollywood Palace.  This show was really good.  Bing Crosby always had the best Christmas Shows!
192,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,good
193,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Yep, this is it, a must have for all Deep Purple fans, hands down.  Read the other reviews, I agree with most of what is written.  Maybe could have had better camera choices, etc.  However, this is THE historical video document of the huge 1980's reunion of the ""classic"" lineup.  We have the album as a marker, which was, and still is damn good stuff.  But also nice to have this footage, and sound quality is damn good.  As a softie, it is so great to see Richie and Ian have a couple of smiling moments between them onstage.  I recently listened to an interview with Ian and he discussed Richie and how they would never cross paths or speak ever again, and that is just the way it is.  But, he also said that he hopes he is happy, and wishes nothing but the best for him, and I felt (softie) that he meant it.  And the performance!!  Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keys, and Vocals all OUTSTANDING.  cheers."
194,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Well, I finally watched this film the other day, and I found it enjoyable---but like my review title says---its no Dark Star!  If you are into these types of movies, I believe you will like Interstellar.  However, there are many opportunities to nitpick away on this.  Dealing with end of humanity type films, I believe the Childhoods End tv miniseries, available on dvd, is superior.  Of course that is based on one of the greatest books by Arthur C. Clarke, so that stacks the deck against Interstellar right off bat.  And, the Childhoods End tv miniseries can't boast the production values of the $150 million spent on Interstellar---it looks stellar, and it should, for that kind of money.  Back to Dark Star---again, if you enjoy this subject matter, you must check out Dark Star---yeah, it is low budget B movie (it was never intended for theatrical release), but it has some scenes that are pure Genius!  And of course, if you like this subject, then go straight to the top with 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Cheers!"
195,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I love this show, but why do we have to wait 1 or 2 years between seasons? Aren't they afraid of losing their audiences?

This is the best animated series around these days, so I hope they continue and actually do the movie they announced and 2 more seasons.

Start from the beginning with Season 1 or you'll be confused a lot. It's a real treat with lots of inside jokes relating to '80s music in particular. Guest appearances (not the actual people's voices, but their images) have included David Bowie, Klaus Nomi, and Iggy Pop as well as allusions to The Art of Noise ""Cose (to the Edit)"" video and more. It's a hoot. There's lots of violence, so it's only for kids over the age of 17 and under the age of 100 years old!"
196,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Aaron Eckhardt is a good actor often playing roles that emphasize his rugged good looks and buff body. He shows in this film that he doesn't have to rely on his appearance to do well. His acting and the special effects are by far the best things about this movie. The script, as is mentioned in the featurette about the making of the film, is a patchwork of the ideas of several writers, and it shows. It opens as a sequel to the original novel, filling us in on what happened after Dr. Frankenstein pursues his ""monster"" into the Arctic, hoping to destroy him once and for all. So far so good. The ""monster"" has become quite articulate and can even read, but that's acceptable after 200 years of being on the loose (despite the fact that he's supposedly on his own during most of that time). It gets messy when two groups of non-humans, demons and gargoyles, begin battling each other for possession of the ""monster"" and/or Dr. Frankenstein's scientific diary. Bothe of these non-human species can and do take human form and fly (demons without visible wings) when they aren't battling. The demons are obviously evil, but what about the demons? Can the ""soulless monster"" really trust them and, if so, when they deceive him once, should he trust them a second time?

There are 2 scientists working for the demons, somehow unaware that they are helping the evil demons realize their plan to reanimate thousands of dead humans who, once dead, are soulless. Once they are reanimated, they, like the ""monster"" can be injected with evils demonic souls from hell. These dead humans with demon souls will then destroy the gargoyles and destroy and/or enslave the rest of mankind.

Eckhardt, as the ""monster"", has to deal with all this whether he likes it or not.

It's an enjoyable watch with lots of high-tech special effects, mostly CGI, so I'd advise fans of the original story to see this, but it's probably not worth watching more than once.  Kudos to Eckhardt for saving the film from being a disaster with only a few seconds of bare chest and scars webbing his face and body. Thanks for rescuing a film that would otherwise have drowned. Now we shall see if a sequel pops up. I doubt once will, as this one didn't make much money and didn't spend much time in the theaters before being released to DVD."
197,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"All of the best of the Universal monsters and a few extras (exorcism, demon possession, Dorian Grey and more) just for fun! As an author of horror, I was surprised at how well this series was written and how creatively interwoven the diverse stories are. The sets and costumes are fantastically accurate for the time period as well. But I must admit, it is Eva Green as Miss Vanessa Ives who steals the series. I wasn't familiar with her before this series, but she's an incredible actress. Her appearance ranges from beautiful to bizarre, and she has an incredible range. You might recognize the actress who plays Brona from the BBC series ""Being Human"" as she was the ghost.

Frankenstein's monster is probably the low point of the series, but that storyline promises to get more interesting in season 2. The acting is excellent all around, although Eva Green tops all.

There's some nudity (full frontal male included) but mainly on dead men. Don't get yourselves in an uproar over that, folks."
198,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Great show due back in January or February of 2017. I can't wait! The acting is good, the star is more than pleasant to look at, the various monsters are fun, and Nick (the star character) has a sidekick werewolf who is often funny as hell. The make-up is very good, especially for a TV show. Keep your zombie this and that, and give me a wide variety of monsters, some good, some bad, and some that change from good to bad or vice versa. I hope the series goes on for a long time!"
199,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Okay, I bought this film---because I couldn't find any other way to see it---because it was fawned over by the press, saying how brilliant it was, and best foreign film, etc.  So then watched it with some friends.  And----it leaves one with a polarized feeling.  At certain times, I thought, yes, this is pretty good.  Then at other times, I thought wow, this is what they say is the best film of the year??  Afterwards, I will admit to thinking about the film, and I guess that is a sign of quality, if it makes you think about it.  This is a relationship film, and deals with aspects of people being together, raising children, trying to keep their relationship vibrant and meaningful and not stale, etc.  SO,  check it out, I probably wouldn't buy it, but if you in mood for foreign film, and the subject matter, perhaps you will find it higher star rating than I....Cheers!"
200,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,seemed ok film
201,AIL0Y2OUE1680,"Some very choppy and odd production going on in this one. There are talking heads who the viewer has no idea who they are. The story seems a bit loose. There are some nice racing scenes but the many situational reenactments are lame to say the least. Viewers also need to be warned that there is one very disturbing scene when talking about the dangers of descending, the lifeless bloody body of Fabian Casartelli is shown. These images had never been shown in the US that I had known or seen. Although the shot is less then five seconds it was disturbing  and indelible. I felt this was unnecessary and disrespectful."
202,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.

I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the ""Charlie Rose"" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.

Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.

I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!"
203,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,ok
204,AFTUJYISOFHY6,Great movie to watch with your children or grandchildren.
205,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Really a fine job on this.  Yes,  it is a tv miniseries, so dosen't have the $200 million budget.  And, it is from one of the greatest sci fi books ever written, by Arthur C. Clarke, up there with his 2001 Space Odyssey.  People can quibble over the production details, but I believe they did well.  And some of the scenes, especially with the Overlords, are incredible!  The opening scene where giant mothership spaceships hover over the largest cities on Earth, was used to open the film Independence Day, which was obviously popcorn entertainment film.  However, if you want heavy duty material, check this out, cheers!"
206,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.

I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable.

207,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This fun remake is really well done with exciting visuals, great cinematography, and fine acting. Spock has been reborn in Zachary; they look so much alike (when Nimoy was young, that is) that it is freakish. Be prepared for some changes, however, in that this film seems to take place in a parallel universe. Spock and Uhurah are fall in love and, apart from some rough spots along the way, carry their love connection into the second film.

The bad guys are pretty good too. Lots of great CGI explosions and emotional tension between Kirk and Spock as they get to know each other. This is a time travel trip, after all, taking the viewer back to what would be considered a prequel by most fans.

Enjoy!"
208,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"A dated and laughable film about a so-called hippy / revolutionary / performer who is campaigning for the voting age to be reduced to 14, etc., etc. Problem is, he looks and behaves more like a preppy frat boy. And his lyrics are mind-numbingly banal. Give this one a miss."
209,AFTUJYISOFHY6,"So far we have watched Christmas in Connecticut and The Shop Around the Corner.  I had never seen either of these original movies before, but had seen re-makes of both.  Believe me, these original versions are GREAT!  You will love them all."
210,A16WO8T4YXGVWP,"Whoever had the idea of getting these members of the Cathedral Quartet together deserves a star!  So many of them have died since then, and we have these wonderful songs by gospel music's premier quartet.  I get tears every time I hear ""I've Just Started Living.""  What a blessing this tape has been!"
211,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,"We were somewhat disappointed in this video.  The talent is good, but there were interviews with various people cut in  between each song.  This made it seem chopped up and it was hard to get into the video, not to mention how distracting it was besides.  The cd had more fill in that seemed to be cut out of the vhs.  It would have been nice to have seen this truer to the way the concert was actually performed instead of just getting the singing.  Probably wouldn't have bought this if I'd known all this above purchasing."
212,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"but may have been cute, i still like these for sabbath, even if i don't get it all first watch i can rewatch other sabbaths if i own it so its ok..ii like them more when longer though maybe but oh well"
213,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I really liked this workout before one if few ones I did like to do-most seem boring-can't it be reissued??
214,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"It figures that there aren't any reviews of this video.  Of course, I shouldn't get too cynical here, because after all, I still can't believe these guys sold a single record!  Thank god they did though, otherwise they would have slipped into oblivion along with some of the bands that inspired them, like the incredible Bad Brains.  When I first heard these guys, it was like a bolt of lightning shot through me!  I was actually lucky enough to see them in concert twice (with Bad Brains).  Oh yeah, the video!  It does a great job of showing the band in action, and gives their story.  If you like hard, fast, rock and punk music, played by incredible musicians, this is your ticket!  I've heard rumours that they might tour with Bad Brains (Soul Brains) and Fishbone when they release their new album, please let it be true!"
215,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I don't know if I really liked it? I think I felt it was hard to follow maybe if I see it again I will get it though who knows..
216,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"great solid workout, you don't have to do the knee splits or whatever they are they are hard andthis whole thing is fun but sort of a challenge like it says, but one of my favorites anyways this and her first one too are great..way better than other crappy exercise videos I never seemed to like to do, although a few of early 80's aerobic we're kind of super fun-but this type I liked a lot in 90's doing daily, but man I just want to do them occasionally now that in 30's I don't have energy to do that often-but good for sometimes-treadmill and one pound weights are better for daily really now that not teen"
217,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Dry humor, an offbeat plot, good acting, and a bit of the Cronenberg (who is in the film) twisted touch all come together to make this an intriguing film worth seeing. A vampire wakes after being in a suspended state for more than 20 years, finds himself gravitating toward a late-night doughnut shop and the waitress/cashier who takes him at face value and is kind to him. In the meantime, his psycho ex-girlfriend is out to get him. Like the idea of a vampire who is likeable? If so, you'll like this film. I didn't know quite what to expect, but I enjoyed it and ended up buying a copy for myself."
218,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"Mike Douglas was not the epitome of ""hip"". So it is kind of surprising he would want John and Yoko -- from their wildest early ""movement"" days -- to be on his show as co-hosts for an entire week. But this is what we have here. It is odd television, to say the least, from the moment Mike walks out on Day 1 and sings ""Michelle"" -- probably thinking he's paying homage to John Lennon, not knowing it was Paul McCartney's song. John saves the day, though, telling Mike that he wrote the middle eight, ""so it's all right"".

There are a lot of weird and fun moments here:
- John's childlike excitement that he gets to play with Chuck Berry
- the expression on Chuck Berry's face when Yoko, playing a drum in the backup band, starts ululating into the microphone during ""Memphis""
- Ralph Nader saying he's not interested in ever running for president (ha!)
- Jerry Rubin, leader of violent 1960s protests, saying he plans to support Nixon because the trip to China has done so much for the cause of communism in the U.S. (he was kidding)
- John and Yoko's first public performance with Elephant's Memory, the band with whom they would soon record the ""Sometime in New York City"" album
- Very interesting little daily interviews with John and Yoko about various aspects of their lives and careers
- A good comedy routine by a very young George Carlin
- Good musical acts including not only John and Yoko and Chuck Berry, but a number of other bands and performers that have since disappeared from sight
- ""Love calls"" -- they call people on the phone at random in various US cities to tell them they love them (this is mainly Yoko's thing)

This set of shows should be a must see for any Beatles or Lennon fan, although the material and the mindset can seem very, very dated today. According to the liner notes, it was shortly after the appearances on this show that John was classified as a left-wing threat to the US and served with deportation papers which he spent many more years fighting. So this is pre-witch hunt John Lennon, still flush with the optimism of America and starting out on a new life with Yoko in New York.

The price is unfortunate and clearly an exaggeration. These shows aren't worth $200, which is what they are asking for this two-DVD set right now on Amazon Marketplace. I found a Brazilian copy, for example (looks genuine enough...) through another major internet sales outlet for a reasonable price. If you look around, you can probably find options out there."
219,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Hello music fans.  First, you can't slag this off because of the very important cause the show is for, its like being upset with the biker gangs who give toys for sick children to the hospitals, you may dislike bikers, but they're giving toys to sick kids man!  So, that being said, some of this music is great and some not so great.  I appreciate that there is a diverse offering in the performers on this, that is always cool, even if you don't like them all.  My favorite performance from this is without a doubt Mr. Plant and Mr. Page.  They just RIP on this!  Yes, they're older, if you can't handle classic rock or ""old man"" rock, then you won't dig this, just remember all you fans who said Radiohead was BRILLIANT on this, they themselves will be ""old man"" rock some day, and then what will you say?  hmmm?!  Jimmy and Robert got together for two excellent tours in the late 1990's, and this is the only official material released on video from the second outing where they were just the power trio with singer format.  They were fantastic, and the Parisian crowd rocks out with them!  So, check it out if you dare, just remember, this is for Amnesty International, not just a concert. Cheers."
220,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I used to love Werner Herzog movies. I still think he is fantastic, but some of his films, especially early ones like ""Even Dwarfs Started Small,"" are really starting to show their age. Still, this might be the ultimate 1960s-70s nihilistic Continental European art film experience.

Starring a cast made up of entirely little people, this movie has kind of a ""the lunatics have taken over the asylum"" theme. Anti-authoritarian in the extreme, it is not a picture for the faint of heart. It starts right out with cannibalistic chickens and moves on to abuse of animals, abuse of the blind, abuse of authority, abuse of fellow human beings... Just abuse all around, really.

The movie revels in the absurd, starting with the entire premise of a world of only little people and going right through the main story elements and visual gags used in the movie -- like a car set to run around and around in circles by itself while little people do whatever they can to rain down destruction all around it.

At the start of the film, the style and tone reminded me of the parody of nihilistic Continental European art films from an episode of Monty Python, where a woman is sitting in a garbage dump on a stool with a cabbage, and a nervous Frenchman smokes a cigarette nearby and eventually says ""I see you have a cabbage,"" pauses for a while and then blurts out ""I am a revolutionary."" That's really the level of message and complexity seen here.

I'm really glad there were Continental European filmmakers in the 1960s and 1970s who made movies like this one. God bless Werner Herzog. Watching this is a blast from the past. But I can't say it's a pleasant or uplifting experience. I'm glad that films like this that revel exclusively, or at least almost exclusively, in the dark side of human nature without taking the light into account have fallen out of fashion.

Still, it's important to see something like this every once in a while. Recommended, but not for people who get easily upset at things like the abuse of animals, the disabled, or people in general."
221,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"it sucks, but you can't watch the regular movie, at least if you get the directors cut version like i did or whatever-not reccomendable..i wanted to see the movie-not them talking over the movies creation..urgh"
222,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"this type of retro game looks fun too bad not reissued on famicon carts some of these, then I would have reason to get the famicon adapter for my nes..they are so rare and.or not affordable now these classics"
223,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Compared to the first ""Mr. Vampire,"" ""Spooky Encounters"" and other Hong Kong comedy-horror films of the mid-'80s, this one is second-rate. It isn't that funny, and the only attempt to create any real monsters is a couple of 'vampires' that don't hop (one reviewer says they hop in the other films as the ground hurts their feet, but attributing the hopping to rigor mortis is a much more logical reason) despite having the appearance of the typical vampire/corpse of these films.

The secondary plot of the dead concubine of a clunky general coming back to life only to imitate every move of the guy who robbed her grave really isn't funny. I'm sure it was difficult to film as well as it was, but it just doesn't provide laughs. Not to mention that part of the plot is left hanging at the end without any resolution.

Maybe worth seeing once, but not worth owning."
224,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,"This is a good video to watch, not outstanding, but has some good laughs.  We will probably watch it again."
225,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a slow, insipid, all-but-plotless film. I suppose a man playing an irresistible woman was a bit of a kick in 1969, but not today, especially as it is obvious the star is not a real woman. Her singing is strictly low-grade Amanda Lear as well. There's no reveal at the end, not a wig pulled off or a reason why this ""enchantress"" destroys the men who fall in love with her the moment they see her. She repeatedly states, ""I'm a bad woman."" I agree, not to mention she's a bad woman in a bad movie. Not even good for a few chuckles."
226,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"My title for this review pretty much sums it up. Hark was feeling his oats by busting butt to do the best special effects he could, and he succeeded quite well, actually. The effects are beautiful, overdone at times, but fascinating as imagery.

The problem is the movie is way too long. It seems to go on forever, leaving the viewer cross-eyed with boredom by the time he gets to all the great special effects at the end of the film. There's also no sense of humor in this film as there is in ""Chinese Ghost Story."" Good luck!"
227,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,one of those end of world movies pretty good ... so yeah good to add to collection if you like maybe
228,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I loved this movie when I first saw it as a kid, and it holds up extremely well today. Booth won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance, and she deserved it! She proves she was capable of portraying so much more than the lovable housekeeper/maid she played for many seasons in the TV series Hazel. Lancaster is rather stiff for most of this film, but that's exactly what was called for, leading up to the explosive climax. A classic with a strong message of understanding that reflects the suffering of alcoholics and those who love them."
229,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Hilarious take-off by Cook and Moore. The British singer Dana Gillespie plays the buxom maid; I bought her first album decades ago and liked it. Other familiar British comedians pop up in the cast. This comedy is, like in most Cook and Moore collaborations, really over the top and hilarious. There's a wonderful take-off scene referencing the projectile vomiting of ""The Exorcist"" and lots of references to other films. I laugh every time I watch this film. I must add, however, that many people seem to have a problem with the DVD not playing correctly. This is such a fun film, it deserves to have a proper DVD version be made available!!!!!!!!!!"
230,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"I love the ""Carry On"" series and most of the characters, but Sydney James and Kenneth Connor just aren't enough to carry this poorly scripted bxw film without the rest of the crew. Shirley Easton appears in the film, as she did in a ""Carry On"" film before she really hit it big, as does Donald Pleasance, later very big in the ""Halloween"" films. Some of the puns and jokes were fun and the actors tried to make the slow script funny, but I fell asleep twice during my viewing and had to rewind each time. I'd rate it a bit under the best of the early ""Carry On' films."
231,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This DVD is very well put together with little snippets between videos, so it has a theme of sorts. Footage from the high old days of Wall of Voodoo, Stan Ridgway's solo videos, and ""live"" footage from both, with a few clips on the road thrown in for good fun. Great stuff, and the quality is quite good, which is surprising considering some of it was recorded unprofessionally and ""live.""

Great fun and oh, the great memories! Plus some fine new ones if you haven't kept up Mr. Ridgway's work since Wall of Voodoo. I believe I saw Tom Waits in the second video in a cameo role as a bartender. Stan's lovely wife, Pietra Wexstun, a fine musician herself (check out Hecate's Angels and Drywall), pops up in the videos around 1989 or so, which is always a plus. In the end, however, it all goes back to ""that radio song"" as Stan calls it, ""Mexican Radio,"" the first video on this collection of over 30 videos, concert footage, and little extras. Also included is Stan's solo hit U.K. single ""Camouflage,"" a great ghost song.

I highly recommend this DVD to fans of Wall of Voodoo and of Stan Ridgway! They were, and he still is, the best! That's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
232,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"seemed pretty good. I mean I like Christian music and maybe books sometimes better than films, but they are still to be cherished even though they are few and not always the best..i still cherish them for Sabbath, they are still good to collect for watching on sundays to keep Sabbath holy and fun for that-this is kind of one of those classics wasn't too bad as far as Christian or any films for that matter goes..you know movies are always a bit dumb just how is..but watchable when in mood for sure with great points and everything you know that are very inspiring if let be"
233,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"An excellent documentary about the making of the show. Pretty much everyone involved who's still alive is interviewed and there's clips from many of the classic skits. However, a major shortcoming is the strange absence of material regarding Michael O'Donoghue, a creative force on the writing staff and occasional performer as well. That reduced my rating from 5 to 3 stars."
234,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"I had my doubts when I read the synopsis of this film. It sounded like a ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" knockoff, with a ping pong ball in Mongolia instead of a Coke bottle in Africa. That's kind of true, but it's only half the story.

I recommend this film for two main reasons. First are the beautiful shots of the plains of Inner Mongolia -- part of China, not Mongolia the independent country. Unending grassy steppes with brooding cloudy skies. Wonderful, and the images alone are probably worth the price of admission.

Second is the glimpse it provides into life on those steppes. The trucks that come by with occasional random goods from afar for trade with the locals -- like a sheep for a coffee set, when the people have no idea what coffee is except that it's a kind of ""American tea"". The close relationship with horses. The apparent use of some occasional electrical equipment, like flashlights and televisions (I wish they had explained the power source for the latter, but I guess that's OK). The possibility that there is a place where a ping pong ball could inspire wonder.

Story is not the film's strong suit, and it does move slowly. Still, it is a charming tale about the innocence of boyhood. I appreciate having seen it, as I now feel I have a very passing familiarity with a world and a way of life I knew next to nothing about before."
235,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This DVD contains no Pink Floyd music, just interviews with the band members.

The content is moderately interesting, but there are a lot of tour-related interviews where interviewers from Europe and the US tend to ask the same questions and get the same answers. For example, asking Nick Mason what he is enjoying playing on the tour and him telling two different interviewers that it's fun to be playing Astonomy Domine after all these years. Or Roger Waters saying on two different occasions that whatever happens in the band's breakup (still ongoing at the time), it will be ""graceful"". There are other similar cases of dja vu.

Roger Waters more than equal coverage, mostly from the post-Floyd period. Some questions about the music, the breakup, the future. Nothing really surprising, but interesting anyway.

Most of the videos honestly look like they were transferred to DVD from somebody's home VCR tapes. You can see and hear acceptably, and since this isn't music this is no big problem, but still the quality seems amateurish.

The interviews are scattered all over the place in terms of timing -- mostly from the 1990s and 1980s, a little from 2000 (you can tell because Waters references George W. Bush as president), and a short clip of Syd Barrett from the 1960s. Maybe just one or two short bits from the 1970s related to ""The Wall"". It is a weakness that there is no indication on the interviews as to when or where they were prepared.

All in all this is worth a view for Pink Floyd fans, but they will find no great revelations. Three stars for them -- but unless you already take a special interest in Pink Floyd, there is no point whatsoever in watching this."

237,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The lead actor is a young Shakespearean stage actor who will forever be embarrassed by this, his first film. The story doesn't make too much sense, the acting is amateur for the most part (the lead guy IS the best actor, but he's not that good), and the special effects are really poor.

A good movie to skip."
238,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This old Unitel production from German television in 1988 is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the real highlights of the late period of Leonard Bernstein. It is more measured, and less sentimental, than many late Bernstein pieces -- although don't get me wrong, I actually love the sentimentality of his late conducting. But this one is different, it is a solemn and powerful reading that manages to be very emotional without exaggerated sentiment.

Bernstein uses the Beyer edition of the Requiem, a revision of the traditional Sussmayer completion of Mozart's unfinished score to make it more ""Mozartian"". The tempi are slow, which is not much of a surprise for late Bernstein. The main program on the DVD has a runtime of about 64 minutes, of which the actual performance is roughly 58 minutes, once you take out a (sort of strange) one-minute break in the middle. Compare this to Harnoncourt's performance of the Beyer edition, which clocks in at just 49 minutes or so. Still, the slowness is not cumbersome, but effective in this performance.

Bernstein dedicated this performance to his deceased wife, as he says in his touching German-language spoken introduction to the piece. I'm a bit skeptical because she had died ten years before the performance. Since Bernstein himself died just two years after the recording, it is tempting to look on this performance more as his own reflection on mortality than a tribute to his wife. This is indeed the feeling I got at the end of the performance, when Bernstein kisses the four solo vocalists and then disappears into the offstage darkness in silence (the audience must have been instructed not to applaud). It had the look and feel of a departure, and was actually quite moving.

The stereo sound is beautiful, and a 5.1 mix is also included on the DVD although I have not heard it. My only problem with the sound was the organ, which kind of distracted me a couple of times as it sounded like it was just hanging out by itself somewhere in the distance on the right channel, almost as if we were hearing the organ from the church next door.

The video looks, well, like it's from German television in 1988. But the church is spectacularly baroque, and the performance by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus is terrific. Highly recommended!"
239,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Another reviewer (""There IS a Plot"") mentions a guide to the plot, characters, etc.  I certainly couldn't make sense of this series, so I guess I need the guide. The manga anime is well done, but every time I thought the show was finally making some sense, it crumbled into total confusion again in short order. I watched it all and still don't get it. Good luck!"
240,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,ok but make sure to get the right language one
241,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"Kent James, alias Nick Normal, is documented here as a performer who lacked control on stage, thus the group had a lot of trouble getting bookings. No full songs are featured in this video, unfortunately, but it provides a taste of the outrageous, punk-like wild man music as well as the acoustic, insightful music by the same musicians. Personally, I like both the punk and the sensitive, thoughtful acoustic songs, but to get the full songs, you have to order the collection of 10 years' of music by Kent James. Nick is openly gay and has a temper that often turned him into a wild man who screamed insults at the audience. In interviews with Nick/Kent and those around him, they all admit this was a problem but offer little explanation for it. He would even scream at the ""little sissies"" in the audience for not acting like masculine gay men. Obviously, very little of this went over well with the audience before they walked out or the plug was pulled on the music. Nick/Kent introduces his lover who is a butch body builder like himself; they appear to really love each other, which is great. Nick's got a really good voice and writes some great songs, so if he ever decides to go back to making music and performing, he just needs to maintain control. I enjoy his the collection CD, but I probably wouldn't have purchased it without seeing this documentary first since, without a larger view of Nick, he can easily be portrayed as just a loud-mouthed wanna-be. He's more than that by far. I'd really like to see Kent do more music, especially songs along the line of the sensitive, deeply-felt songs, some of which are actually quite beautiful. I am glad Kent lives in San Francisco as I do too. Without the Mohawk, I probably wouldn't recognize him on the street, but if I did, I'd encourage him to make more records."
242,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"When I saw this DVD was over two hours long, I figured it would be a great introduction for me. I am just beginning to explore Maria Callas as an opera performer, and I figured it would have some excellent documentary coverage -- I had visions of the new ""Karajan"" DVD from Deutsche Gramophone in my head. A nice, definitive kind of documentary. I was very, very mistaken.

The biographic documentary film on the DVD is terribly short at under 15 minutes, and it is up for free on the EMI Classics website anyway. So although I hadn't seen any other Callas documentaries, this is exactly the one I had seen already.

Regarding the performances, I am fortunate enough to get the French cable channel ""Mezzo"" where I live, and they show most of the performances included on this DVD on a semi-regular basis. So I had seen most of those too. I have also seen a few of these on YouTube. They are from old French TV shows and such -- all concert/recital footage, no actual opera performances. And it looks like they are all from fairly late in Callas' career.

That leaves the interview footage, about an hour's worth, as material that was sort of new. It was very interesting. But even here, quite a bit is already on YouTube and in other places -- more old TV shows. Moreover, I had been considering buying some Callas interview discs anyway. Now I won't, out of fear I'd just be duplicating again. If you want Callas interviews, just go to the dedicated discs for that, don't bother with this selection of previously released materials.

I found this DVD pretty shameless in its warming over of leftover material. I know very little about Callas and basically came out not much wiser even after watching it.

If you don't browse the web for footage of things that interest you, and instead just go straight to DVD purchases, this might be good for you. But if you've even casually surfed around for Callas footage before deciding you want a DVD, there is a very good chance you've got these bases covered already.

UPDATE Aug 2009: I found the definitive documentary I had been looking for.

243,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,"This is a good dvd.  We didn't know as many of the songs as the Kingsgold 2, but still very good.  These two groups sound wonderful together.  It also showcases several of the men as did their second dvd.  Glad we purchased both of them."
244,A2M1CU2IRZG0K9,This dvd showcases a lot of good southern gospel talent.  These two groups sound great together and we enjoyed it very much.  Good buy for the money.  :)
245,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"OK, I'll admit it. Call me shallow and sentimental, call me a lover of pastoral fluff. But Ralph Vaughan Williams is my favorite composer. There you have it.

Until I saw this treat of a documentary, however, I knew surprisingly little about the man. For me he was a black box, out of which came sounds that epitomized 20th century English composition in all its non-Continental, non-intellectualized glory.

And for the record, as the film points out, and as anyone who actually listens to Vaughan Williams will tell you, his music goes far beyond pastoral fluff. There is real darkness there as well, reflecting his experience in World War I and the turbulence of World War II -- not to mention difficulties in his first marriage. One family eyewitness, for example, calls his 4th Symphony a ""rage"" against his first wife.

That is the kind of first-hand familiarity with the subject that this documentary is filled with. It is a welcome relief to have not only experts and biographers, but also friends, associates and family members commenting on Vaughan Williams' life and work. (Not to mention quite a few spliced-in voiceovers by Vaughan Williams himself.) The same type of first-hand knowledge was also characteristic of the only other Tony Palmer documentary I have seen to date -- his treatment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maria-Callas/dp/B000S84NMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maria Callas</a>. I plan to look up more of Palmer's classical documentaries.

Other reviewers have complained about the graphic images of suffering children contained in the film, which are intended to convey the horrors that lie behind the composer's work. I can see their point. The images are gratuitous and they were a mistake in this film. But not a fatal one. Overall, this is a great work for anyone interested in Vaughan Williams and his music. Five stars and more -- highly recommended!"
246,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"hello.  Don't usually write up reviews of things I don't like, but was intrigued by the Onion connection, plus Chevy Chase, plus the several positive reviews.  Sadly, for me, it didn't cut it.  Yes, Chase is great, a bit of a curve ball, but he is only in the film for 10 minutes.  The rest of the time, it is the two hapless losers, running around.  I don't think I laughed once.  Maybe a chuckle or two.  It just isn't very good.  I think the last time I didn't dig a ""indie"" piece like this, which had some potential, was the video rental film with Jack Black and Mos Def, just didn't like it, but it was better than this.  The one main actor has a Chris Farley thing going on, but I still didn't think it was good."
247,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I enjoyed watching these on Sabbath-very cool idea stories of missionaries live on the field of saving souls..adventuresome too going all these places and learning of cultures
248,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"shows them exploring and giving talks at churches in between, pretty cool idea, glad they filmed it-I like to see a bit of what missionary trips are like never got to go on one."
249,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a very low-budget film with poor acting, lousy sound and a very spotty, slow storyline. Much of the early part of the script seems to be taken almost directly from Bahr's bio of Sister, LEAST OF ALL SAINTS. About 1/4 of the way into the film, the story jumps around, making it appear that Sister was an overnight sensation earning enough to build the multi-million dollar Angelus Temple, her own radio station, the huge parsonage and her school after preaching a short time when, in fact it took years of endless labor before she became rich and famous. Minnie Kennedy, her mother, played a vital and prominent role in Sister's entire life, but in this film, she plays a rather small role. James Kennedy, Sister's father, died before the infamous kidnapping trial, but in this film he comforts and advises her throughout the trial. Mimi Michaels is erratic in the role. She's very unconvincing most of the time, but at times she acts and sounds quite like the real Sister did. The makers of the film apparently couldn't decide if Sister was a self-deceiving, charismatic person, a complete fraud, or a force for good. I don't recommend this film. See the PBS documentary bio instead, or read one of the bios published about her life. She was quite the character!"
250,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This film presents the story of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, arguably the greatest conductor of the 20th century, as told mainly through interviews with his widow Elisabeth. She shares personal memories, anecdotes, letters and photos in this short, 70-minute documentary.

The strength of the movie is clearly just the fact that this is Furtw&auml;ngler's wife, telling a story that no one else could tell. A narrator gives background information and reads from Furtw&auml;ngler's writings about how he reacted to various aspects of his career -- such as starting a career in conducting when he really just wanted to be a composer. There is some nice footage of Furtw&auml;ngler conducting in rehearsal and concert.

Elisabeth Furtw&auml;ngler does talk about her husband's well-known womanizing and illegitimate children, and she also talks about his decision to stay in Germany despite the Nazi regime taking power in 1933. While the film is not a whitewash of Furtw&auml;ngler, it certainly presents him in a positive light overall. It is nice to get a feeling for his personal attitudes and characteristics through his wife's eyes.

On the other hand, the absence of any details whatsoever on the years under the Nazi regime is a big hole in the film and its most obvious shortcoming. Who better than his wife could have given us a picture of the man's personal attitudes and reactions to life under the Nazis?

The film does provide a great service by getting interviews with Furtw&auml;ngler's wife recorded for posterity. This is a personal story only she can tell, and I'm grateful the film was made.

But in the end, it is a flawed work as well. The filmmakers don't really succeed in creating a compelling narrative that would be of significance to anyone who is not already a fan of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler and who does not know the basics of his life already. So you might consider rental options instead of a purchase straightaway.

Note that the DVD has no video extras -- total run time is 70 minutes. However, it does contain quite a collection of MP3 files on the disc of interviews, rehearsals etc with Furtw&auml;ngler (in German). The MP3s are not accessible through the DVD menu. To see them, put the DVD in your computer and look at the disc in Windows Explorer or the equivalent on a Mac. From there you can copy to your hard disc using drag-and-drop.

I would also highly recommend two films that deal more with the ""dark side"" of Furtw&auml;ngler's collaboration with the Nazi regime, still without condemning the man:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reichsorchester-The-Berlin-Philharmonic/dp/B0012K53UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reichsorchester: The Berlin Philharmonic</a>&nbsp;and the fictional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Sides/dp/B0001DCR0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Sides</a>."
251,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This bxw footage appears to have been shot, for the most part, while a female reporter was trying to get some straight answers from Dali, something he almost never gave. She gets justifiably frustrated at his nonsensical responses, rude actions and idiotic actions. The self-proclaimed ""Divine Dali"" was a showman through and through, but he was a very boring one most of the time and babbled gibberish. I was bored by most of this short film. At least there's no footage of him in his main self-described persona, ""The Great Masturbator."" That we don't need to see despite the fact that he did it often and got his entourage to join in -- as long as no one, especially any woman, touched him. I was very disappointed in this film that I got through Netflix. It's not worth the money by any means and only deserves one watching."
252,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This NOVA program is very well done, but it is less than an hour in length. The ""Breaking the Maya Code"" DVD (cracking vs. breaking) is nearly 2 hours in length and is even better. I recommend both."
253,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"good witness to show how important not to fall away from Christianity because then may lead to less full more miserable life like this shows anyways..although even if Christians suffer it could be to expiate sins and if turned to love still for good of them and all, but yes good witness film of why good to stay Christian to be on happy safe side of inspiration of fuller life and such."
254,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This documentary covers the four years of preparation of the Chinese national baseball team ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Although baseball had been well-known in China, it died out during the Mao era.

According to the manager of the Chinese team, former US big-leaguer Jim Lefebvre, this wasn't due to any ideological problem with baseball -- just a lack of funding and budgets to keep baseball going in the 1960s and 70s. So China had an earlier baseball culture that had practically died out, and the Chinese turned to MLB in the US for help. MLB sent Lefebve and pitching coach Bruce Hurst, who was later replaced by Steve Ontiveros.

The movie compresses four years into a single hour-long documentary, so there isn't a great level of detail, but it does show clips from a few important games. Against Cuba in Italy three years before the Olympics, where China was absolutely demolished. But there was a bright spot during the same games in Italy, when China actually defeated Taiwan -- which has a pretty good baseball culture.

Two and a half years before the Olympics, China played in an Asian series in Tokyo, and got creamed by Japan. Lefebvre is overheard telling an umpire that the team would be on a ""low A"" level in the US -- meaning class A in the minor leagues.

There are other major losses, but still a tone of optimism is maintained. There seems to be acceptance of the fact that China has a lot of catching up to do in developing a baseball culture.

The weakest part of the film is that it ends two months before the Olympics start, so there is a feeling that you don't get the payoff of finding out the end of the story. This is actually a pretty important weakness. If it had covered the games I probably would have given it five stars.

If you like stories of baseball in different cultures, you'll like this movie. I would also recommend it to anyone with a China interest.

If you are fortunate enough to have read and enjoyed the classic book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Gotta-Have-Wa/dp/0307455971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Gotta Have Wa</a>, about US-Japanese baseball relations, I'm sure you'll love this movie. The subject matter is different --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Gotta-Have-Wa/dp/0307455971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Gotta Have Wa</a>&nbsp;is about Americans (including Jim Lefebvre) trying to fit in to (and improve) the already established baseball culture in Japan, while this film is about China trying to fit in to international baseball culture and turning to Americans for help. But the basic theme is the same -- East meets West, on the baseball field and off, and tries to take what it can use to help its own game."
255,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"and it didn't skip on my computer, only on my vcr..so it wasn't fault of the product i guess when i retried it"
256,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,I liked the other vhs I got of this with different cover that says its 70's 50's version..but is this same version I was thinking should I get it too?
257,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,"This is a very good introduction to John Adams, the operatic composer. The main drawback to this 58-minute documentary film is its near complete disregard for John Adams, the instrumental composer.

The film starts off with biographical background and a discussion of some of Adams' works, the development of his style, and the relationship of his music to the minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. There are some excerpts and brief mentions of works like ""Harmonielehre"" and the ""Chamber Symphony"".

But once discussion starts going on ""Nixon in China"", opera becomes the exclusive focus. There is good, if brief, background on both ""Nixon in China"" and ""The Death of Klinghoffer"" with interviews from Adams, librettist Alice Goodman, and director Peter Sellars.

I really enjoyed what this documentary had, I just feel that a full documentary on John Adams would need to devote at least a similar level of attention and detail to his instrumental works. Also, I love good long documentaries, and could easily have enjoyed more detail on these operas as well -- even a full-length feature on ""Nixon in China"" alone.

The only other content on the disc is a 28-minute infomercial from EMI trying to get you to buy other EMI DVDs. Nice clips, but advertisements nonetheless.

Overall this is a a nice little film and a good introduction to John Adams as far as it goes, but a star must be docked for not going farther. And with that, I may be too generous. In my view this is a solid three-and-a-half star outing. Certainly not worth the $30 it is currently going for with shipping -- think about possible rental options."
258,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"This is a good selection of Betty Boop cartoons, including samples of her early 'toons and the later ones made under the thumb of censorship.

One reviewer complained that the final 8 cartoons on the second disk were too dark and thus of lesser quality. I didn't find this to be the case on the set I have.

The earlier cartoons are a bit racy, but they are the best in my estimation. I was introduced to Betty Boop through watching the early ones with soundtracks by the great Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and other early jazz greats who were actually not major stars at the time. The later 'toons made after the censors came down on the Fleischer Bros. are fun too. They tend to be cuter with her little dog and Grampy, etc., so they are different but also fun. Until a truly definitive, complete collection is released, I recommend this one."
259,A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,"I've been waiting for a great concert film of this band since I first became aware of them (and a huge fan) well over a decade ago. ""Three Days"" was a terrible disappointment because it chopped up all the music! And black market videos on eBay were of very poor quality. ""Live Voodoo"" fills the void - and then some! The greatest songs and the original line-up presented with outstanding sound and visuals. Who could ask for anything more? If you are a fan of JA, get this Blu-ray!"
260,A3TNYNA2360NPA,"The plot is a little sketchy in this made-for-TV movie; there are some real gaps. The ""supernatural"" killer is fairly typical, although the blurriness and darkness that surround him is a nice touch. The acting is overdone a tad, especially by the actor who plays the sheriff. To be honest, the best part of the movie is Brad Thornton. The man's a pretty good actor, has a great sensitive face, and a great body. He's the best part of the movie, especially for those 10 or 15 seconds (twice) near the end of the film when he is shirtless. No, I obviously have no shame!

261,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,these are good Christian classics for sunday or collecting just cuz good to have inspiring stuff when in mood-very important points in these for new Christians or discouraged people this had some points for this just like many Christian things do-they are even good for unbelievers many are geared towards helping convince them too-so try it and see if helps if are one
262,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,some of these films are ok for Sabbath sometimes they seem a bit worldly so they can relate to non Christians but then can inspire and evangelise them too-so if that's what you need that's cool and also shows hopefulness of maybe how evangelism can help and be done..forgot some of these plots but we're pretty good films all of them I think ok to collect for Sabbath viewing like I say the different ones in series-maybe look for sample online youtube if on there or billy graham movie site to see what are like first and if sounds/looks good then get it cuz good to see more than once maybe if like
263,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,story about man looking for father in Amsterdam Europe and has Christian themes
264,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,pretty good about young man rebelling with father and Christian topics
265,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,pretty good
266,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,ok
267,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"This show is really great---but NOTE!!  The early seasons are NOT good!!  I started watching right before they got rid of a couple of the guys that Mark was always fighting with. The show is hugely improved since then!  I think season five is where it is just Mark, Royal, Will, Dave, and a few others including his daughter.  The focus is much more on the cars, and the work that the team does is incredible.  Just amazing that they can bring back pieces of junk that in some cases have been rotting for decades, and they bring them back to better than the day they rolled off the factory floor!  On the side, Mark is good for keeping things light, and I find it funny, others might not, but again, show is 100% better than what it was in early seasons,  Cheers!"
268,A3478QRKQDOPQ2,"such brilliant idea to put all these in one collection, so I could give away some I had like six duplicates that are all on this collection..helps clear room of so much stuff..since I am collector of Sabbath films this helps a lot for me I need all room I can get"
269,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,"Really really good!  Missed this when it came out, they were showing on tv and I watched couple episodes, then saw it was available on DVD and bought it.  The whole show is great!  The actors, the writing, the overall premise, just a lot of laughs, well done!  I'm curious what the people who didn't like this are in to?  It is for adults, I really liked Community, but this was better, if you looking for comparison.  Cheers!"

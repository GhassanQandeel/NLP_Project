0,"really happy they got evangelised .. spoiler alert==happy ending liked that..since started bit worrisome... but yeah great stories these missionary movies, really short only half hour but still great"
1,"Having lived in West New Guinea (Papua) during the time period covered in this video, it is realistic, accurate, and conveys well the entrance of light and truth into a culture that was for centuries dead to and alienated from God."
2,Excellent look into contextualizing the Gospel and God's sovereignty over cultural barriers. The book and movie are both captivating. I would definitely recommend to both Christians and non-believers.
3,"More than anything, I've been challenged to find ways to share Christ is a culturally relevant way to those around me.  Peace child is a cherished ""how to"" for me to do that."
4,"This is a great movie for a missionary going into a foreign country, especially one that is not used to foreign presence. But, it was a little on the short side."
5,This movie was in ENGLISH....it was a great summary of the book and the experience of the Richardsons while in New Guinea.
6,"This is a fascinating true story, well acted by many of the actual characters.  Watch this and see just one of countless examples of how faithfully God works out ways for all of mankind to find Him, in every culture."
7,This DVD appears to be in German. It is not in english. I do not speak German.  This needs to be corrected. I want my $1.99 back.
8,This movie is not in English although the title of the movie is as is the book. There is no forewarning anywhere that the movie is not in English. Sounds like it might be Russian?
9,"So sorry I didn't purchase this years ago when it first came out!!  This is very good and entertaining!  We absolutely loved it and anticipate seeing it repeatedly.  We actually wore out the cassette years back, so we also purchased this same product on cd.  Best purchase we made out of all!  Would purchase on dvd if we could find one."
10,"Product received quickly from seller. Product was in great condition as stated. People who enjoy southern gospel music will be thrilled with this offering by the various Cathedral performers, with the exception of Payne and Younce, down through the years. Also quite happy with service. Would use seller again."
11,Believe me when I tell you that you will receive a blessing watching this video of the Cathedral Quartet.  They bring back most of the singers that were ever in their group and it is a really great VHS.
12,This video arrived in perfect shape to the far away country of New Zealand It is a really blessing to see all the different members of the quartet over the years. Great singing! Pastor Greg
13,"The Reunion of the Cathedral Quartet in 1995 was an effort to salute the men who had contributed to this great Southern Gospel quartet.  The driving force behind the quartet was Glen Payne and George Younce, who remained with the group through several personnel changes.  This video is full of moments of laughter and sentiment, and the music is outstanding."

15,This is truly a moving video to watch if you like great southern gospel quartets. It has some of the greatest singers that have made up the greatest gospel quartet of all time and even the ones that have not been  with the Cathedrals for 30 years still sound fantastic. It is a blessing to  watch.
16,"It is an excellent experience to watch this DVD after all these years of being an X fan.  It was also very cool to watch this right after a repeated viewing of the DVD X--The Unheard Music (1985).  X still has every ounce of energy and connection it had back then. The only reason I gave it four stars is that John Doe's Bass is overshadowed in the mix.  But having said that, it is a DVD I will treasure for years to come."
17,"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come."
18,"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!"
19,"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????"
20,"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living."
21,"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait."
22,"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers."
23,"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good."
24,"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real."
25,"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!"
26,"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good."
27,"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!"
28,I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.
29,"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!"
